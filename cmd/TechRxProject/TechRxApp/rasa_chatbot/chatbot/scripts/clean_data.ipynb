      "{'Acne': 'acne also known as acne vulgaris is a longterm skin condition that occurs when dead skin cells and oil from the skin clog hair follicles typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads pimples oily skin and possible scarring it primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands including the face upper part of the chest and back the resulting appearance can lead to lack of confidence anxiety reduced selfesteem and in extreme cases depression or thoughts of suicidesusceptibility to acne is primarily genetic in  of cases the roles of diet and cigarette smoking in the condition are unclear and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part in both sexes hormones called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism by causing increased production of sebum another common factor is the excessive growth of the bacterium cutibacterium acnes which is present on the skintreatments for acne are available including lifestyle changes medications and medical procedures eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may minimize the condition treatments applied directly to the affected skin such as azelaic acid benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are commonly used antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne however resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy several types of birth control pills help prevent acne in women medical professionals typically reserve isotretinoin pills for severe acne due to greater potential side effects early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall longterm impact on individualsin  acne affected approximately  million people globally making it the eighthmost common disease worldwide acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated – of teenagers in the western world some rural societies report lower rates of acne than industrialized ones children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty although acne becomes less common in adulthood it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continues to have difficulties in their fortiesthe severity of acne vulgaris gr ἀκµή point  l vulgaris common can be classified as mild moderate or severe to determine an appropriate treatment regimen there is no universally accepted scale for grading acne severity the presence of clogged skin follicles known as comedones limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions defines mild acne moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face compared to mild cases of acne and appear on the trunk of the body severe acne is said to occur when nodules the painful bumps lying under the skin are the characteristic facial lesions and involvement of the trunk is extensivelarge nodules were previously called cysts the term nodulocystic has been used in the medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne true cysts are rare in those with acne and the term severe nodular acne is now the preferred terminologyacne inversa l invertō upsidedown and acne rosacea rosa rosecolored  āceus forming are not forms of acne and are alternate names that respectively refer to the skin conditions hidradenitis suppurativa hs and rosacea although hs shares certain overlapping features with acne vulgaris such as a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris the condition otherwise lacks the hallmark features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disordertypical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin microcomedones comedones papules nodules large papules pustules and often results in scarring the appearance of acne varies with skin color it may result in psychological and social problemsacne scars are caused by inflammation within the dermis and are estimated to affect  of people with acne vulgaris abnormal healing and dermal inflammation create the scar scarring is most likely to take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesionatrophic acne scars have lost collagen from the healing response and are the most common type of acne scar accounting for approximately  of all acne scars icepick scars boxcar scars and rolling scars are subtypes of atrophic acne scars boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from – mm across icepick scars are narrow less than  mm across deep scars that extend into the dermis rolling scars are broader than icepick and boxcar scars – mm across and have a wavelike pattern of depth in the skinhypertrophic scars are uncommon and are characterized by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response they are described as firm and raised from the skin hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin and usually occur on the trunk of the bodyin november  a study was published exposing the consensus of twentyfour renowned international plastic surgeons and dermatologists about the most effective energybased devices for the treatment of acne scarsafter an inflamed nodular acne lesion resolves it is common for the skin to darken in that area which is known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation pih the inflammation stimulates specialized pigmentproducing skin cells known as melanocytes to produce more melanin pigment which leads to the skins darkened appearance pih occurs more frequently in people with darker skin color pigmented scar is a common term used for pih but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent often pih can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of the nodule and can fade with time however untreated pih can last for months years or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected even minimal skin exposure to the suns ultraviolet rays can sustain hyperpigmentation daily use of spf  or higher sunscreen can minimize such a riskrisk factors for the development of acne other than genetics have not been conclusively identified possible secondary contributors include hormones infections diet and stress studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive sunlight and cleanliness are not associated with acneacne appears to be highly heritable genetics explain  of the variation in the population studies performed in affected twins and firstdegree relatives further demonstrate the strongly inherited nature of acne acne susceptibility is likely due to the influence of multiple genes as the disease does not follow a classic mendelian inheritance pattern these gene candidates include certain variations in tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfalpha il alpha and cypa genes among others the  ga single nucleotide polymorphism variation in the gene for tnf is associated with an increased risk for acne acne can be a feature of rare genetic disorders such as aperts syndrome severe acne may be associated with xyy syndromehormonal activity such as occurs during menstrual cycles and puberty may contribute to the formation of acne during puberty an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum the androgen hormones testosterone dihydrotestosterone dht and dehydroepiandrosterone dhea are all linked to acne high levels of growth hormone gh and insulinlike growth factor  igf are also associated with worsened acne both androgens and igf seem to be essential for acne to occur as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais or laron syndrome insensitivity to gh resulting in very low igf levelsmedical conditions that commonly cause a highandrogen state such as polycystic ovary syndrome congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgensecreting tumors can cause acne in affected individuals conversely people who lack androgenic hormones or are insensitive to the effects of androgens rarely have acne pregnancy can increase androgen levels and consequently oily sebum synthesis acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or anabolic steroid use overthecounter bodybuilding and dietary supplements often contain illegally added anabolic steroidsthe anaerobic bacterial species cutibacterium acnes formerly propionibacterium acnes contributes to the development of acne but its exact role is not well understood there are specific substrains of c acnes associated with normal skin and others with moderate or severe inflammatory acne it is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve onsite or are acquired or possibly both depending on the person these strains have the capability of changing perpetuating or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation oil production and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores infection with the parasitic mite demodex is associated with the development of acne it is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acnehighglycemicload diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lowerglycemicload diet to be effective in reducing acne there is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine igf and precursors of dihydrotestosterone studies suggest these components promote the effects of insulin and igf and thereby increase the production of androgen hormones sebum and promote the formation of comedones available evidence does not support a link between eating chocolate or salt and acne severity few studies have examined the relationship between obesity and acne vitamin b may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne acneiform eruptions or worsen existing acne when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intakethere are few highquality studies to demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne despite being controversial some research indicates that increased acne severity is associated with high stress levels in certain contexts such as hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndromesome individuals experience severe intensification of their acne when they are exposed to hot humid climates this is due to bacteria and fungus thriving in warm moist environments this climate induced acne exacerbation has been termed tropical acne mechanical obstruction of skin follicles with helmets or chinstraps can worsen preexisting acne however when acne is caused by mechanical obstruction it is not considered a form of acne vulgaris when being very technical it would be an other acneiform eruption known as acne mechanica several medications can also worsen preexisting acne this condition is the acne medicamentosa form of acne examples of such medications include lithium hydantoin isoniazid glucocorticoids iodides bromides and testosterone when acne medicamentosa is specifically caused by anabolic–androgenic steroids it can simply be referred to as steroid acne genetically susceptible individuals can get acne breakouts as a result of polymorphous light eruption a condition triggered by sunlight and artificial uv light exposure this form of acne is called acne aestivalis and its specifically caused by intense uva light exposure affected individuals usually experience seasonal acne breakouts on their upper arms shoulder girdle back and chest the breakouts typically occur onetothree days after theyve been exposed to intese uva radiation unlike other forms of acne the condition spares the face this could possibly be a result of the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption in which areas of the skin that are newly exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation are affected since faces are typically left uncovered at all stages of life theres littletono likelihood for an eruption to appear there studies show that both polymorphous light eruption outbreaks and the acne aestivalis breakout response can be prevented by topical antioxidants combined with the application of a broad spectrum sunscreenacne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of the pilosebaceous unit and develops due to blockages in the skins hair follicles these blockages occur as a result of the following four abnormal processes increased oily sebum production influenced by androgens excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation colonization of the follicle by cutibacterium acnes c acnes bacteria and the local release of proinflammatory chemicals in the skinthe earliest pathologic change is the formation of a plug a microcomedone which is driven primarily by excessive growth reproduction and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle in healthy skin the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle in people with acne the increased production of oily sebum causes the dead skin cells to stick together the accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle thus forming the microcomedone the c acnes biofilm within the hair follicle worsens this process if the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance known as a blackhead or open comedo in contrast if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle this causes the formation of a whitehead known as a closed comedothe main hormonal driver of oily sebum production in the skin is dihydrotestosterone another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is dheas the adrenal glands secrete higher amounts of dheas during adrenarche a stage of puberty and this leads to an increase in sebum production in a sebumrich skin environment the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium c acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system c acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several proinflammatory chemical signals such as ilα il tnfα and ltb ilα is essential to comedo formationc acnes ability to bind and activate a class of immune system receptors known as tolllike receptors tlrs especially tlr and tlr is a core mechanism of acnerelated skin inflammation activation of tlr and tlr by c acnes leads to increased secretion of ilα il and tnfα the release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils macrophages and th cells ilα stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction which in turn fuels comedo development furthermore sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides such as hbd and hbd in response to the binding of tlr and tlrc acnes also provokes skin inflammation by altering the fatty composition of oily sebum oxidation of the lipid squalene by c acnes is of particular importance squalene oxidation activates nfκb a protein complex and consequently increases ilα levels additionally squalene oxidation increases lipoxygenase enzyme activity which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene b ltb ltb promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor alpha pparα protein pparα increases the activity of activator protein  ap and nfκb thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory t cells c acnes ability to convert sebum triglycerides to proinflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase further explains its inflammatory properties these free fatty acids spur increased production of cathelicidin hbd and hbd thus leading to further inflammationthis inflammatory cascade typically leads to the formation of inflammatory acne lesions including papules infected pustules or nodules if the inflammatory reaction is severe the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules the involvement of ap in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade activates matrix metalloproteinases which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formationalong with the bacteria c acnes the bacterial species staphylococcus epidermidis s epidermidis also takes a part in the physiopathology of acne vulgaris the proliferation of s epidermidis with c acnes causes the formation of biofilms which blocks the hair follicles and pores creating an anaerobic environment under the skin this enables for increased growth of both c acnes and s epidermidis under the skin the proliferation of c acnes causes the formation of biofilms and a biofilm matrix making it even harder to treat the acneacne vulgaris is diagnosed based on a medical professionals clinical judgment the evaluation of a person with suspected acne should include taking a detailed medical history about a family history of acne a review of medications taken signs or symptoms of excessive production of androgen hormones cortisol and growth hormone comedones blackheads and whiteheads must be present to diagnose acne in their absence an appearance similar to that of acne would suggest a different skin disorder microcomedones the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads are not visible to the naked eye when inspecting the skin and require a microscope to be seen many features may indicate that a persons acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences historical and physical clues that may suggest hormonesensitive acne include onset between ages  and  worsening the week before a womans period acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin and inflammatorynodular acne lesionsseveral scales exist to grade the severity of acne vulgaris but disagreement persists about the ideal one for diagnostic use cooks acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from  to  with higher numbers representing more severe acne this scale was the first to use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity since its creation in  the scale has undergone several revisions the leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face back and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or noninflammatory leeds scores range from  least severe to  most severe though modified scales have a maximum score of  the pillsbury acne grading scale classifies the severity of the acne from grade  least severe to grade  most severemany skin conditions can mimic acne vulgaris and these are collectively known as acneiform eruptions such conditions include angiofibromas epidermal cysts flat warts folliculitis keratosis pilaris milia perioral dermatitis and rosacea among others age is one factor that may help distinguish between these disorders skin disorders such as perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is also more suggestive of rosacea the presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance chloracne and occupational acne due to exposure to certain chemicals  industrial compounds may look very similar to acne vulgarismany different treatments exist for acne these include alpha hydroxy acid antiandrogen medications antibiotics antiseborrheic medications azelaic acid benzoyl peroxide hormonal treatments keratolytic soaps nicotinamide retinoids and salicylic acid acne treatments work in at least four different ways including the following reducing inflammation hormonal manipulation killing c acnes and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage typical treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics benzoyl peroxide and retinoids and systemic therapies including antibiotics hormonal agents and oral retinoidsrecommended therapies for firstline use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids benzoyl peroxide and topical or oral antibiotics procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not firstline treatments and typically have only an add on role due to their high cost and limited evidence blue light therapy is of unclear benefit medications for acne target the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions acne generally improves between eight and twelve weeks after starting therapypeople often view acne as a shortterm condition some expecting it to disappear after puberty this misconception can lead to depending on selfmanagement or problems with longterm adherence to treatment communicating the longterm nature of the condition and better access to reliable information about acne can help people know what to expect from treatmentsin general it is recommended that people with acne do not wash affected skin more than twice daily the application of a fragrancefree moisturizer to sensitive and acneprone skin may reduce irritation skin irritation from acne medications typically peaks at two weeks after onset of use and tends to improve with continued use dermatologists recommend using cosmetic products that specifically say noncomedogenic oilfree and wont clog poresacne vulgaris patients even those with oily skin should moisturize in order to support the skins moisture barrier since skin barrier dysfunction may contribute to acne moisturizers especially ceramidecontaining moisturizers as an adjunct therapy are particularly helpful for the dry skin and irritation that commonly results from topical acne treatment studies show that ceramidecontaining moisturizers are important for optimal skin care they enhance acne therapy adherence and complement existing acne therapies in a study where acne patients used  clindamycin phosphate   benzoyl peroxide gel in the morning and applied a micronized  tretinoin gel in the evening the overwhelming majority of patients experienced no cutaneous adverse events throughout the study it was concluded that using ceramide cleanser and ceramide moisturizing cream caused the favorable tolerability did not interfere with the treatment efficacy and improved adherence to the regimen the importance of preserving the acidic mantle and its barrier functions is widely accepted in the scientific community thus maintaining a ph in the range    is essential in order to keep the skin surface in its optimal healthy conditionscausal relationship is rarely observed with dietnutrition and dermatologic conditions rather associations — some of them compelling — have been found between diet and outcomes including disease severity and the number of conditions experienced by a patient evidence is emerging in support of medical nutrition therapy as a way of reducing the severity and incidence of dermatologic diseases including acne researchers observed a link between high glycemic index diets and acne dermatologists also recommend a diet low in simple sugars as a method of improving acne as of  the available evidence is insufficient to use milk restriction for this purposebenzoyl peroxide bpo is a firstline treatment for mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild sideeffects mainly skin irritation in the skin follicle benzoyl peroxide kills c acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid these free radicals likely interfere with the bacteriums metabolism and ability to make proteins additionally benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation combination products use benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxideclindamycin and benzoyl peroxideadapalene respectively topical benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acneside effects include increased skin photosensitivity dryness redness and occasional peeling sunscreen use is often advised during treatment to prevent sunburn lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are just as effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects unlike antibiotics benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial antibiotic resistanceretinoids are medications that reduce inflammation normalize the follicle cell life cycle and reduce sebum production they are structurally related to vitamin a studies show dermatologists and primary care doctors underprescribe them for acne the retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining this helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage they are a firstline acne treatment especially for people with darkcolored skin retinoids are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentationtopical retinoids include adapalene retinol retinaldehyde isotretinoin tazarotene trifarotene and tretinoin they often cause an initial flareup of acne and facial flushing and can cause significant skin irritation generally speaking retinoids increase the skins sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin whereas adapalene is the least irritating but costs significantly more most formulations of tretinoin are incompatible for use with benzoyl peroxide tazarotene is the most effective and expensive topical retinoid but is usually not as well tolerated in  a tazarotene lotion formulation marketed to be a less irritating option was approved by the fda retinol is a form of vitamin a that has similar but milder effects and is present in many overthecounter moisturizers and other topical productsisotretinoin is an oral retinoid that is very effective for severe nodular acne and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments one to two months of use is typically adequate to see improvement acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a – month course of oral isotretinoin after a single round of treatment about  of people report an improvement with more than  reporting complete remission about  of people require a second course but  of those report improvement resulting in a cumulative  efficacy ratethere are concerns that isotretinoin is linked to adverse effects like depression suicidality and anemia there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims isotretinoin has been found in some studies to be superior to antibiotics or placebo in reducing acne lesions however a  review comparing inflammatory lesions after treatment with antibiotics or isotretinoin found no difference the frequency of adverse events was about twice as high with isotretinoin use although these were mostly drynessrelated events no increased risk of suicide or depression was conclusively foundmedical authorities strictly regulate isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy for such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control in  the united states started the ipledge program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy ipledge requires the woman to have two negative pregnancy tests and to use two types of birth control for at least one month before isotretinoin therapy begins and one month afterward the effectiveness of the ipledge program is controversial due to continued instances of contraception nonadherencepeople may apply antibiotics to the skin or take them orally to treat acne they work by killing c acnes and reducing inflammation although multiple guidelines call for healthcare providers to reduce the rates of prescribed oral antibiotics many providers do not follow this guidance oral antibiotics remain the most commonly prescribed systemic therapy for acne widespread broadspectrum antibiotic overuse for acne has led to higher rates of antibioticresistant c acnes strains worldwide especially to the commonly used tetracycline eg doxycycline and macrolide antibiotics eg topical erythromycin therefore dermatologists prefer antibiotics as part of combination therapy and not for use alonecommonly used antibiotics either applied to the skin or taken orally include clindamycin erythromycin metronidazole sulfacetamide and tetracyclines eg doxycycline or minocycline doxycycline  milligrams daily lowdose appears to have similar efficacy to  milligrams daily and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects however lowdose doxycycline is not fdaapproved for the treatment of acne antibiotics applied to the skin are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne oral antibiotics are generally more effective than topical antibiotics and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use togetheroral antibiotics are recommended for no longer than three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration are associated with the development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter durations if longterm oral antibiotics beyond three months are used then it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid be used at the same time to limit the risk of c acnes developing antibiotic resistancethe antibiotic dapsone is effective against inflammatory acne when applied to the skin it is generally not a firstline choice due to its higher cost and a lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics topical dapsone is sometimes a preferred therapy in women or for people with sensitive or darkertoned skin it is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to the risk of causing yelloworange skin discoloration with this combination minocycline is an effective acne treatment but it is not a firstline antibiotic due to a lack of evidence that it is better than other treatments and concerns about its safety compared to other tetracyclinessarecycline is the most recent oral antibiotic developed specifically for the treatment of acne and is fdaapproved for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne in patients nine years of age and older it is a narrowspectrum tetracycline antibiotic that exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against pathogens related to acne vulgaris and a low propensity for inducing antibiotic resistance in clinical trials sarecycline demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing inflammatory acne lesions as early as three weeks and reduced truncal back and chest acnein women the use of combined birth control pills can improve acne these medications contain an estrogen and a progestin they work by decreasing the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries and by decreasing the free and hence biologically active fractions of androgens resulting in lowered skin production of sebum and consequently reduce acne severity firstgeneration progestins such as norethindrone and norgestrel have androgenic properties and may worsen acne although oral estrogens decrease igf levels in some situations which could theoretically improve acne symptoms combined birth control pills do not appear to affect igf levels in fertile women cyproterone acetatecontaining birth control pills seem to decrease total and free igf levels combinations containing third or fourthgeneration progestins including desogestrel dienogest drospirenone or norgestimate as well as birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate or chlormadinone acetate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects studies have shown a  to  reduction in acne lesions with combined birth control pills a  review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at reducing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months however the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory noninflammatory and total acne lesions the authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred firstline acne treatment over oral antibiotics in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance in contrast to combined birth control pills progestogenonly birth control forms that contain androgenic progestins have been associated with worsened acneantiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone can successfully treat acne especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum or scalp hair loss spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women unlike combined birth control pills it is not approved by the united states food and drug administration for this purpose spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and is a useful acne treatment due to its ability to additionally block the androgen receptor at higher doses alone or in combination with a birth control pill spironolactone has shown a  to  reduction in acne lesions in women the effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dosedependent highdose cyproterone acetate alone reportedly decreases acne symptoms in women by  to  within three months it is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency the medication appears to be effective in the treatment of acne in males with one study finding that a high dosage reduced inflammatory acne lesions by  however spironolactone and cyproterone acetates side effects in males such as gynecomastia sexual dysfunction and decreased bone mineral density generally make their use for male acne impracticalpregnant and lactating women should not receive antiandrogens for their acne due to a possibility of birth disorders such as hypospadias and feminization of male babies women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking an antiandrogen antiandrogens are often combined with birth control pills for this reason which can result in additive efficacy the fda added a blackbox warning to spironolactone about possible tumor risks based on preclinical research with very high doses fold clinical doses and cautioned that unnecessary use of the medication should be avoided however several large epidemiological studies subsequently found no greater risk of tumors in association with spironolactone in humans conversely strong associations of cyproterone acetate with certain brain tumors have been discovered and its use has been restricted the brain tumor risk with cyproterone acetate is due to its strong progestogenic actions and is not related to antiandrogenic activity nor shared by other antiandrogensflutamide a pure antagonist of the androgen receptor is effective in treating acne in women it appears to reduce acne symptoms by  to  even at low doses with several studies showing complete acne clearance in one study flutamide decreased acne scores by  within three months whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only  in the same period in a large longterm study  of women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide although effective flutamide has a risk of serious liver toxicity and cases of death in women taking even low doses of the medication to treat androgendependent skin and hair conditions have occurred as such the use of flutamide for acne has become increasingly limited and it has been argued that continued use of flutamide for such purposes is unethical bicalutamide a pure androgen receptor antagonist with the same mechanism as flutamide and with comparable or superior antiandrogenic efficacy but with a far lower risk of liver toxicity is an alternative option to flutamide in the treatment of androgendependent skin and hair conditions in womenclascoterone is a topical antiandrogen that has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of acne in both males and females and was approved for clinical use for this indication in august  it has shown no systemic absorption or associated antiandrogenic side effects in a small direct headtohead comparison clascoterone showed greater effectiveness than topical isotretinoin αreductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride may be useful for the treatment of acne in both males and females but have not been adequately evaluated for this purpose moreover αreductase inhibitors have a strong potential for producing birth defects in male babies and this limits their use in women however αreductase inhibitors are frequently used to treat excessive facialbody hair in women and can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy there is no evidence as of  to support the use of cimetidine or ketoconazole in the treatment of acnehormonal treatments for acne such as combined birth control pills and antiandrogens may be considered firstline therapy for acne under many circumstances including desired contraception known or suspected hyperandrogenism acne during adulthood acne that flares premenstrually and when symptoms of significant sebum production seborrhea are copresent hormone therapy is effective for acne both in women with hyperandrogenism and in women with normal androgen levelsazelaic acid is effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a – concentration treatment twice daily for six months is necessary and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide  isotretinoin  and erythromycin  azelaic acid is an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle and its antibacterial and antiinflammatory properties it has a slight skinlightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis therefore it is useful in treating individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation azelaic acid may cause skin irritation it is less effective and more expensive than retinoids azelaic acid also led to worse treatment response when compared to benzoyl peroxide when compared to tretinoin azelaic acid makes little or no treatment responsesalicylic acid is a topically applied betahydroxy acid that stops bacteria from reproducing and has keratolytic properties it is less effective than retinoid therapy salicylic acid opens obstructed skin pores and promotes the shedding of epithelial skin cells dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application though darkening of the skin can occur in individuals with darker skin typestopical and oral preparations of nicotinamide the amide form of vitamin b are alternative medical treatments nicotinamide reportedly improves acne due to its antiinflammatory properties its ability to suppress sebum production and its wound healing properties topical and oral preparations of zinc are suggested treatments for acne evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited zincs capacities to reduce inflammation and sebum production as well as inhibit c acnes growth are its proposed mechanisms for improving acne antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their antiinflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum productionhydroquinone lightens the skin when applied topically by inhibiting tyrosinase the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine to the skin pigment melanin and is used to treat acneassociated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation by interfering with the production of melanin in the epidermis hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis the use of a sunscreen with spf  or higher in the morning with reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area hydroquinone is generally welltolerated side effects are typically mild eg skin irritation and occur with the use of a higher than the recommended  concentration most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people in extremely rare cases the frequent and improper application of highdose hydroquinone has been associated with a systemic condition known as exogenous ochronosis skin discoloration and connective tissue damage from the accumulation of homogentisic acidcombination therapy—using medications of different classes together each with a different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated to be a more effective approach to acne treatment than monotherapy the use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together is more effective than antibiotics alone similarly using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone frequently used combinations include the following antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide antibiotic and topical retinoid or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide dermatologists generally prefer combining benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistancealthough sebaceous gland activity in the skin increases during the late stages of pregnancy pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity in general topically applied medications are considered the firstline approach to acne treatment during pregnancy as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide pregnancy category c and azelaic acid category b salicylic acid carries a category c safety rating due to higher systemic absorption – and an association between the use of antiinflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies ductus arteriosus blood vessel prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive sealed dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm tretinoin category c and adapalene category c are very poorly absorbed but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester the data examining the association between maternal topical retinoid exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited a systematic review of observational studies concluded that such exposure does not appear to increase the risk of major birth defects miscarriages stillbirths premature births or low birth weight similarly in studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy fetal harm has not been seen in the second and third trimesters nevertheless since rare harms from topical retinoids are not ruled out they are not recommended for use during pregnancy due to persistent safety concerns retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin all category x spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenictopical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin erythromycin and metronidazole all category b due to negligible systemic absorption nadifloxacin and dapsone category c are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women but have received less study no adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone if retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy all category b include azithromycin cephalosporins and penicillins tetracyclines category d are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel their use during pregnancy has been associated with the development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reasonlimited evidence supports comedo extraction but it is an option for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment another procedure for immediate relief is the injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed acne comedo electrocautery and electrofulguration are effective alternative treatments for comedoneslight therapy is a treatment method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths of light to an area of skin affected by acne both regular and laser light have been used the evidence for light therapy as a treatment for acne is weak and inconclusive various light therapies appear to provide a shortterm benefit but data for longterm outcomes and outcomes in those with severe acne are sparse it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications a  metaanalysis was unable to conclude whether light therapies were more beneficial than placebo or no treatment nor the duration of benefitwhen regular light is used immediately following the application of a sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy pdt pdt has the most supporting evidence of all light therapy modalities pdt treats acne by using various forms of light eg blue light or red light that preferentially target the pilosebaceous unit once the light activates the sensitizing substance this generates free radicals and reactive oxygen species in the skin which purposefully damage the sebaceous glands and kill c acnes bacteria many different types of nonablative lasers ie lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light have been used to treat acne including those that use infrared wavelengths of light ablative lasers such as co and fractional types have also been used to treat active acne and its scars when ablative lasers are used the treatment is often referred to as laser resurfacing because as mentioned previously the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation persistent facial redness and persistent pain physiologically certain wavelengths of light used with or without accompanying topical chemicals are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost the need for multiple visits the time required to complete the procedures and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities typical side effects include skin peeling temporary reddening of the skin swelling and postinflammatory hyperpigmentationdermabrasion is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties icepick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth the procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight redness and decreased pigmentation of the skin dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with the introduction of laser resurfacing unlike dermabrasion there is no evidence that microdermabrasion is an effective treatment for acnedermal or subcutaneous fillers are substances injected into the skin to improve the appearance of acne scars fillers are used to increase natural collagen production in the skin and to increase skin volume and decrease the depth of acne scars examples of fillers used for this purpose include hyaluronic acid polymethyl methacrylate microspheres with collagen human and bovine collagen derivatives and fat harvested from the persons own body autologous fat transfermicroneedling is a procedure in which an instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over the skin to elicit a wound healing response and stimulate collagen production to reduce the appearance of atrophic acne scars in people with darker skin color notable adverse effects of microneedling include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and tram track scarring described as discrete slightly raised scars in a linear distribution similar to a tram track the latter is thought to be primarily attributable to improper technique by the practitioner including the use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needlessubcision is useful for the treatment of superficial atrophic acne scars and involves the use of a small needle to loosen the fibrotic adhesions that result in the depressed appearance of the scarchemical peels can be used to reduce the appearance of acne scars mild peels include those using glycolic acid lactic acid salicylic acid jessners solution or a lower concentration  of trichloroacetic acid these peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid – are considered to be mediumstrength peels and affect the skin as deep as the papillary dermis formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to  or more are considered to be deep chemical peels mediumstrength and deepstrength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes infection and small white superficial cysts known as miliaresearchers are investigating complementary therapies as treatment for people with acne lowquality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne tea tree oil appears to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid but is associated with allergic contact dermatitis proposed mechanisms for tea tree oils antiacne effects include antibacterial action against c acnes and antiinflammatory properties numerous other plantderived therapies have demonstrated positive effects against acne eg basil oil oligosaccharides from seaweed however few welldone studies have examined their use for this purpose there is a lack of highquality evidence for the use of acupuncture herbal medicine or cupping therapy for acnemany overthecounter treatments in many forms are available which are often known as cosmeceuticals certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne in those with oily skin a waterbased product is often preferredacne usually improves around the age of  but may persist into adulthood permanent physical scarring may occur rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas osteoma cutis and acne with facial edema early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of these poor outcomesthere is good evidence to support the idea that acne and associated scarring negatively affect a persons psychological state worsen mood lower selfesteem and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders depression and suicidal thoughtsmisperceptions about acnes causative and aggravating factors are common and people with acne often blame themselves and others often blame those with acne for their condition such blame can worsen the affected persons sense of selfesteem until the th century even among dermatologists the list of causes was believed to include excessive sexual thoughts and masturbation dermatologys association with sexually transmitted infections especially syphilis contributed to the stigmaanother psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples irrespective of the severity of their acne this can lead to significant scarring changes in the affected persons skin pigmentation and a cyclic worsening of the affected persons anxiety about their appearanceglobally acne affects approximately  million people or about  of the population as of  it affects nearly  of people in western societies during their teenage years but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood while acne that first develops between the ages of  and  is uncommon it affects  of women and  of men older than  years of age and has a lifetime prevalence of  about  of those affected have moderate or severe cases it is slightly more common in females than males  versus  in those over  years old  of males and  of females still have problemsrates appear to be lower in rural societies while some research has found it affects people of all ethnic groups acne may not occur in the nonwesternized peoples of papua new guinea and paraguayacne affects – million people in the united states  and approximately – million in australia  severe acne tends to be more common in people of caucasian or amerindian descent than in people of african descenthistorical records indicate pharaohs had acne which may be the earliest known reference to the disease sulfurs usefulness as a topical remedy for acne dates back to at least the reign of cleopatra – bce the sixthcentury greek physician aëtius of amida reportedly coined the term ionthos ίονθωξ or acnae which seems to be a reference to facial skin lesions that occur during the acme of life pubertyin the th century the french physician and botanist françois boissier de sauvages de lacroix provided one of the earlier descriptions of acne he used the term psydracia achne to describe small red and hard tubercles that altered a persons facial appearance during adolescence and were neither itchy nor painfulthe recognition and characterization of acne progressed in  when josef plenck an austrian physician published a book that proposed the novel concept of classifying skin diseases by their elementary initial lesions in  the english dermatologist robert willan refined plencks work by providing the first detailed descriptions of several skin disorders using morphologic terminology that remains in use today thomas bateman continued and expanded on robert willans work as his student and provided the first descriptions and illustrations of acne accepted as accurate by modern dermatologists erasmus wilson in  was the first to make the distinction between acne vulgaris and rosacea the first professional medical monograph dedicated entirely to acne was written by lucius duncan bulkley and published in new york in scientists initially hypothesized that acne represented a disease of the skins hair follicle and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum during the s they observed bacteria by microscopy in skin samples from people with acne investigators believed the bacteria caused comedones sebum production and ultimately acne during the midtwentieth century dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor sebum bacteria or excess keratin fully accounted for the disease in its entirety this led to the current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore changes in sebum production and inflammationthe approach to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century retinoids became a medical treatment for acne in  benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in  and remains a staple of acne treatment the introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics such as minocycline modified acne treatment in the s these reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin plays an important role in causing acne subsequently in the s tretinoin original trade name retin a was found to be an effective treatment the development of oral isotretinoin sold as accutane and roaccutane followed in  after its introduction in the united states scientists identified isotretinoin as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy in the united states more than  women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between  and  with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage approximately  babies were born with birth defects due to maternal use of isotretinoin during pregnancytreatment of acne with topical crushed dry ice known as cryoslush was first described in  but is no longer performed commonly before  the use of xrays was also a common treatmentthe costs and social impact of acne are substantial in the united states acne vulgaris is responsible for more than  million doctor visits and costs over us billion each year in direct costs similarly acne vulgaris is responsible for  million doctor visits each year in the united kingdom sales for the top ten leading acne treatment brands in the us in  amounted to  millionacne vulgaris and its resultant scars are associated with significant social and academic difficulties that can last into adulthood during the great depression dermatologists discovered that young men with acne had difficulty obtaining jobs until the s many people viewed acne as a trivial problem among middleclass girls because unlike smallpox and tuberculosis no one died from it and a feminine problem because boys were much less likely to seek medical assistance for it during world war ii some soldiers in tropical climates developed such severe and widespread tropical acne on their bodies that they were declared medically unfit for dutyefforts to better understand the mechanisms of sebum production are underway this research aims to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production eg igf and alphamelanocytestimulating hormone other sebumlowering medications such as topical antiandrogens peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor modulators and inhibitors of the stearoylcoa desaturase enzyme are also a focus of research efforts particles that release nitric oxide into the skin to decrease skin inflammation caused by c acnes and the immune system have shown promise for improving acne in early clinical trials another avenue of earlystage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebumproducing glands in the skins hair follicles to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearancethe use of antimicrobial peptides against c acnes is under investigation as a treatment for acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance in  scientists reported the first genome sequencing of a c acnes bacteriophage pa the authors proposed applying this research toward the development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment to overcome the problems associated with longterm antibiotic use such as bacterial resistance oral and topical probiotics are under evaluation as treatments for acne probiotics may have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skins ceramide content as of  knowledge of the effects of probiotics on acne in humans was limiteddecreased levels of retinoic acid in the skin may contribute to comedo formation researchers are investigating methods to increase the skins production of retinoic acid to address this deficiency a vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganismsacne can occur on cats dogs and horses', 'Allergy': 'allergies also known as allergic diseases refer to a number of conditions caused by the hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment these diseases include hay fever food allergies atopic dermatitis allergic asthma and anaphylaxis symptoms may include red eyes an itchy rash sneezing coughing a runny nose shortness of breath or swelling note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditionscommon allergens include pollen and certain foods metals and other substances may also cause such problems food insect stings and medications are common causes of severe reactions their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors the underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin e antibodies ige part of the bodys immune system binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine diagnosis is typically based on a persons medical history further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases positive tests however may not necessarily mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in questionearly exposure of children to potential allergens may be protective treatments for allergies include avoidance of known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines in severe reactions injectable adrenalin epinephrine is recommended allergen immunotherapy which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites its use in food allergies is unclearallergies are common in the developed world about  of people are affected by allergic rhinitis about  of people have at least one food allergy and about  have or have had atopic dermatitis at some point in time depending on the country about – of people have asthma anaphylaxis occurs in between – of people rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing the word allergy was first used by clemens von pirquet in many allergens such as dust or pollen are airborne particles in these cases symptoms arise in areas in contact with air such as the eyes nose and lungs for instance allergic rhinitis also known as hay fever causes irritation of the nose sneezing itching and redness of the eyes inhaled allergens can also lead to increased production of mucus in the lungs shortness of breath coughing and wheezingaside from these ambient allergens allergic reactions can result from foods insect stings and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain bloating vomiting diarrhea itchy skin and hives food allergies rarely cause respiratory asthmatic reactions or rhinitis insect stings food antibiotics and certain medicines may produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis multiple organ systems can be affected including the digestive system the respiratory system and the circulatory system depending on the severity anaphylaxis can include skin reactions bronchoconstriction swelling low blood pressure coma and death this type of reaction can be triggered suddenly or the onset can be delayed the nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding but may recur throughout a period of timesubstances that come into contact with the skin such as latex are also common causes of allergic reactions known as contact dermatitis or eczema skin allergies frequently cause rashes or swelling and inflammation within the skin in what is known as a weal and flare reaction characteristic of hives and angioedemawith insect stings a large local reaction may occur in the form of an area of skin redness greater than  cm in size that can last one to two days this reaction may also occur after immunotherapyrisk factors for allergies can be placed in two broad categories namely host and environmental factors host factors include heredity sex race and age with heredity being by far the most significant however there have been recent increases in the incidence of allergic disorders that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood environmental pollution allergen levels and dietary changesdust mite allergy also known as house dust allergy is a sensitization and allergic reaction to the droppings of house dust mites the allergy is common and can trigger allergic reactions such as asthma eczema or itching it is the manifestation of a parasitosis the mites gut contains potent digestive enzymes notably peptidase  that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing the mites exoskeleton can also contribute to allergic reactions unlike scabies mites or skin follicle mites house dust mites do not burrow under the skin and are not parasitica wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions but  of allergic responses to foods are caused by cows milk soy eggs wheat peanuts tree nuts fish and shellfish other food allergies affecting less than  person per  population may be considered rare the use of hydrolyzed milk baby formula versus standard milk baby formula does not appear to affect the riskthe most common food allergy in the us population is a sensitivity to crustacea although peanut allergies are notorious for their severity peanut allergies are not the most common food allergy in adults or children severe or lifethreatening reactions may be triggered by other allergens and are more common when combined with asthmarates of allergies differ between adults and children children can sometimes outgrow peanut allergies egg allergies affect one to two percent of children but are outgrown by about twothirds of children by the age of  the sensitivity is usually to proteins in the white rather than the yolkmilkprotein allergies are most common in children approximately  of milkprotein reactions are immunoglobulin emediated with the remaining usually attributable to inflammation of the colon some people are unable to tolerate milk from goats or sheep as well as from cows and many are also unable to tolerate dairy products such as cheese roughly  of children with a milk allergy will have a reaction to beef beef contains small amounts of proteins that are present in greater abundance in cows milk lactose intolerance a common reaction to milk is not a form of allergy at all but due to the absence of an enzyme in the digestive tractcitation neededthose with tree nut allergies may be allergic to one or to many tree nuts including pecans pistachios pine nuts and walnuts in addition seeds including sesame seeds and poppy seeds contain oils in which protein is present which may elicit an allergic reactionallergens can be transferred from one food to another through genetic engineering however genetic modification can also remove allergens little research has been done on the natural variation of allergen concentrations in unmodified cropslatex can trigger an igemediated cutaneous respiratory and systemic reaction the prevalence of latex allergy in the general population is believed to be less than one percent in a hospital study  in  surgical patients  percent reported latex sensitivity although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher between seven and ten percent researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens such as operating rooms intensivecare units and dental suites these latexrich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteinsthe most prevalent response to latex is an allergic contact dermatitis a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry crusted lesions this reaction usually lasts – hours sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions possibly leading to ulcerations anaphylactic reactions occur most often in sensitive patients who have been exposed to a surgeons latex gloves during abdominal surgery but other mucosal exposures such as dental procedures can also produce systemic reactionslatex and banana sensitivity may crossreact furthermore those with latex allergy may also have sensitivities to avocado kiwifruit and chestnut these people often have perioral itching and local urticaria only occasionally have these foodinduced allergies induced systemic responses researchers suspect that the crossreactivity of latex with banana avocado kiwifruit and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally homologous with some other plant proteinsabout  of people report that they are allergic to penicillin however  turn out not to be serious allergies only occur in about typically insects which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects wasps bees hornets and ants or biting insects mosquitoes ticks stinging insects inject venom into their victims whilst biting insects normally introduce anticoagulantscitation neededanother nonfood protein reaction urushiolinduced contact dermatitis originates after contact with poison ivy eastern poison oak western poison oak or poison sumac urushiol which is not itself a protein acts as a hapten and chemically reacts with binds to and changes the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells the immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body causing a tcellmediated immune response of these poisonous plants sumac is the most virulent the resulting dermatological response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness swelling papules vesicles blisters and streakingestimates vary on the percentage of the population that will have an immune system response approximately  percent of the population will have a strong allergic response to urushiol in general approximately  percent to  percent of adults will develop a rash if they are exposed to  milligrams ×− gr of purified urushiol but some people are so sensitive that it takes only a molecular trace on the skin to initiate an allergic reactionallergic diseases are strongly familial identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about  of the time the same allergy occurs about  of the time in nonidentical twins allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children and those childrens allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of nonallergic parents some allergies however are not consistent along genealogies parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system but the specific allergen is notthe risk of allergic sensitization and the development of allergies varies with age with young children most at risk several studies have shown that ige levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of  and  years the peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under ethnicity may play a role in some allergies however racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to migration it has been suggested that different genetic loci are responsible for asthma to be specific in people of european hispanic asian and african originsallergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a thmediated immune response many bacteria and viruses elicit a thmediated immune response which downregulates th responses the first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the th arm of the immune system leads to an overactive th arm which in turn leads to allergic disease in other words individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy since our bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens when they are not exposed to this level the immune system will attack harmless antigens and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune responsethe hygiene hypothesis was developed to explain the observation that hay fever and eczema both allergic diseases were less common in children from larger families which were it is presumed exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings than in children from families with only one child the hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated by immunologists and epidemiologists and has become an important theoretical framework for the study of allergic disorders it is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries the hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to symbiotic bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development along with infectious agentscitation neededepidemiological data support the hygiene hypothesis studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and it is presumed cleaner the use of antibiotics in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases the use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma as has birth by caesarean section rather than vaginal birthchronic stress can aggravate allergic conditions this has been attributed to a t helper  thpredominant response driven by suppression of interleukin  by both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis stress management in highly susceptible individuals may improve symptomsallergic diseases are more common in industrialized countries than in countries that are more traditional or agricultural and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in urban populations versus rural populations although these differences are becoming less defined historically the trees planted in urban areas were predominantly male to prevent litter from seeds and fruits but the high ratio of male trees causes high pollen counts a phenomenon that horticulturist tom ogren has called botanical sexismalterations in exposure to microorganisms is another plausible explanation at present for the increase in atopic allergy endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as tnfα ifnγ interleukin and interleukin from white blood cells leukocytes that circulate in the blood certain microbesensing proteins known as tolllike receptors found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processesgutworms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies recent research has shown that some common parasites such as intestinal worms eg hookworms secrete chemicals into the gut wall and hence the bloodstream that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite this gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that coevolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only in the presence of the parasites without them the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive in particular research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants however the research to support this theory is conflicting with some studies performed in china and ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies it may be that the term parasite could turn out to be inappropriate and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work for more information on this topic see helminthic therapyin the initial stages of allergy a type i hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen encountered for the first time and presented by a professional antigenpresenting cell causes a response in a type of immune cell called a th lymphocyte a subset of t cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin il these th cells interact with other lymphocytes called b cells whose role is production of antibodies coupled with signals provided by il this interaction stimulates the b cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as ige secreted ige circulates in the blood and binds to an igespecific receptor a kind of fc receptor called fcεri on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response the igecoated cells at this stage are sensitized to the allergenif later exposure to the same allergen occurs the allergen can bind to the ige molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils crosslinking of the ige and fc receptors occurs when more than one igereceptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators cytokines interleukins leukotrienes and prostaglandins from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects such as vasodilation mucous secretion nerve stimulation and smooth muscle contraction this results in rhinorrhea itchiness dyspnea and anaphylaxis depending on the individual allergen and mode of introduction the symptoms can be systemwide classical anaphylaxis or localized to specific body systems asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermisafter the chemical mediators of the acute response subside latephase responses can often occur this is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils lymphocytes eosinophils and macrophages to the initial site the reaction is usually seen – hours after the original reaction cytokines from mast cells may play a role in the persistence of longterm effects latephase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils and are still dependent on activity of th cellsalthough allergic contact dermatitis is termed an allergic reaction which usually refers to type i hypersensitivity its pathophysiology involves a reaction that more correctly corresponds to a type iv hypersensitivity reaction in type iv hypersensitivity there is activation of certain types of t cells cd that destroy target cells on contact as well as activated macrophages that produce hydrolytic enzymescitation neededeffective management of allergic diseases relies on the ability to make an accurate diagnosis allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies correct diagnosis counseling and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduce the incidence of symptoms and need for medications and improve quality of life to assess the presence of allergenspecific ige antibodies two different methods can be used a skin prick test or an allergy blood test both methods are recommended and they have similar diagnostic valueskin prick tests and blood tests are equally costeffective and health economic evidence shows that both tests were costeffective compared with no test early and more accurate diagnoses save cost due to reduced consultations referrals to secondary care misdiagnosis and emergency admissionsallergy undergoes dynamic changes over time regular allergy testing of relevant allergens provides information on if and how patient management can be changed to improve health and quality of life annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk egg soy and wheat have been outgrown and the testing interval is extended to – years for allergy to peanut tree nuts fish and crustacean shellfish results of followup testing can guide decisionmaking regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or reintroduce allergenic food into the dietskin testing is also known as puncture testing and prick testing due to the series of tiny punctures or pricks made into the patients skin tiny amounts of suspected allergens andor their extracts eg pollen grass mite proteins peanut extract are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye the inkdye should be carefully selected lest it cause an allergic response itself a small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin sometimes the allergens are injected intradermally into the patients skin with a needle and syringe common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the backif the patient is allergic to the substance then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within  minutes this response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a fullblown hive called wheal and flare in more sensitive patients similar to a mosquito bite interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity with − meaning borderline reactivity and  being a large reaction increasingly allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction interpretation by welltrained allergists is often guided by relevant literature some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergyif a serious lifethreatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has taken antihistamines in the last several dayspatch testing is a method used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin it tests for delayed reactions it is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy or contact dermatitis adhesive patches usually treated with several common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers are applied to the back the skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice usually at  hours after application of the patch and again two or three days lateran allergy blood test is quick and simple and can be ordered by a licensed health care provider eg an allergy specialist or general practitioner unlike skinprick testing a blood test can be performed irrespective of age skin condition medication symptom disease activity and pregnancy adults and children of any age can get an allergy blood test for babies and very young children a single needle stick for allergy blood testing is often gentler than several skin pricksan allergy blood test is available through most laboratories a sample of the patients blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis and the results are sent back a few days later multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample allergy blood tests are very safe since the person is not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedurethe test measures the concentration of specific ige antibodies in the blood quantitative ige test results increase the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect symptoms a rule of thumb is that the higher the ige antibody value the greater the likelihood of symptoms allergens found at low levels that today do not result in symptoms cannot help predict future symptom development the quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to help predict and follow the disease development estimate the risk of a severe reaction and explain crossreactivitya low total ige level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens statistical methods such as roc curves predictive value calculations and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other these methods have shown that patients with a high total ige have a high probability of allergic sensitization but further investigation with allergy tests for specific ige antibodies for a carefully chosen of allergens is often warrantedlaboratory methods to measure specific ige antibodies for allergy testing include enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa or eia radioallergosorbent test rast and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay feiachallenge testing challenge testing is when tiny amounts of a suspected allergen are introduced to the body orally through inhalation or via other routes except for testing food and medication allergies challenges are rarely performed when this type of testing is chosen it must be closely supervised by an allergisteliminationchallenge tests this testing method is used most often with foods or medicines a patient with a suspected allergen is instructed to modify his diet to totally avoid that allergen for a set time if the patient experiences significant improvement he may then be challenged by reintroducing the allergen to see if symptoms are reproducedunreliable tests there are other types of allergy testing methods that are unreliable including applied kinesiology allergy testing through muscle relaxation cytotoxicity testing urine autoinjection skin titration rinkel method and provocative and neutralization subcutaneous testing or sublingual provocationbefore a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed other plausible causes of the presenting symptoms should be considered vasomotor rhinitis for example is one of many illnesses that share symptoms with allergic rhinitis underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis once a diagnosis of asthma rhinitis anaphylaxis or other allergic disease has been made there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergygiving peanut products early may decrease the risk of allergies while only breastfeeding during at least the first few months of life may decrease the risk of dermatitis there is no good evidence that a mothers diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk of allergies nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful early exposure to potential allergens may actually be protectivefish oil supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk probiotic supplements during pregnancy or infancy may help to prevent atopic dermatitismanagement of allergies typically involves avoiding the allergy trigger and taking medications to improve the symptoms allergen immunotherapy may be useful for some types of allergiesseveral medications may be used to block the action of allergic mediators or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes these include antihistamines glucocorticoids epinephrine adrenaline mast cell stabilizers and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases anticholinergics decongestants and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil chemotaxis are also commonly used although rare the severity of anaphylaxis often requires epinephrine injection and where medical care is unavailable a device known as an epinephrine autoinjector may be usedallergen immunotherapy is useful for environmental allergies allergies to insect bites and asthma its benefit for food allergies is unclear and thus not recommended immunotherapy involves exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen in an effort to change the immune systems responsemetaanalyses have found that injections of allergens under the skin is effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children and in asthma the benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped it is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis allergic forms of asthma and stinging insectsto a lesser extent the evidence also supports the use of sublingual immunotherapy for rhinitis and asthma for seasonal allergies the benefit is small in this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections immunotherapy is not recommended as a standalone treatment for asthmaan experimental treatment enzyme potentiated desensitization epd has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective epd uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme betaglucuronidase to which tregulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favoring desensitization or downregulation rather than sensitization epd has also been tried for the treatment of autoimmune diseases but evidence does not show effectivenessa review found no effectiveness of homeopathic treatments and no difference compared with placebo the authors concluded that based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of homeopathic treatmentsaccording to the national center for complementary and integrative health us the evidence is relatively strong that saline nasal irrigation and butterbur are effective when compared to other alternative medicine treatments for which the scientific evidence is weak negative or nonexistent such as honey acupuncture omega s probiotics astragalus capsaicin grape seed extract pycnogenol quercetin spirulina stinging nettle tinospora or guduchi the allergic diseases—hay fever and asthma—have increased in the western world over the past – decades increases in allergic asthma and other atopic disorders in industrialized nations it is estimated began in the s and s with further increases occurring during the s and s although some suggest that a steady rise in sensitization has been occurring since the s the number of new cases per year of atopy in developing countries has in general remained much loweralthough genetic factors govern susceptibility to atopic disease increases in atopy have occurred within too short a period to be explained by a genetic change in the population thus pointing to environmental or lifestyle changes several hypotheses have been identified to explain this increased rate increased exposure to perennial allergens may be due to housing changes and increased time spent indoors and a decreased activation of a common immune control mechanism may be caused by changes in cleanliness or hygiene and exacerbated by dietary changes obesity and decline in physical exercise the hygiene hypothesis maintains that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections it is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from th type responses leading to unrestrained th responses that allow for an increase in allergychanges in rates and types of infection alone however have been unable to explain the observed increase in allergic disease and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecaloral pathogens such as hepatitis a toxoplasma gondii and helicobacter pylori which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than  and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma it is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering thth regulation important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins exposure to pets and growing up on a farmsome symptoms attributable to allergic diseases are mentioned in ancient sources particularly three members of the roman julioclaudian dynasty augustus claudius and britannicus are suspected to have a family history of atopy the concept of allergy was originally introduced in  by the viennese pediatrician clemens von pirquet after he noticed that patients who had received injections of horse serum or smallpox vaccine usually had quicker more severe reactions to second injections pirquet called this phenomenon allergy from the ancient greek words ἄλλος allos meaning other and ἔργον ergon meaning workall forms of hypersensitivity used to be classified as allergies and all were thought to be caused by an improper activation of the immune system later it became clear that several different disease mechanisms were implicated with a common link to a disordered activation of the immune system in  a new classification scheme was designed by philip gell and robin coombs that described four types of hypersensitivity reactions known as type i to type iv hypersensitivity with this new classification the word allergy sometimes clarified as a true allergy was restricted to type i hypersensitivities also called immediate hypersensitivity which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions involving ige antibodiesa major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of allergy was the discovery of the antibody class labeled immunoglobulin e ige ige was simultaneously discovered in – by two independent groups ishizakas team at the childrens asthma research institute and hospital in denver usa and by gunnar johansson and hans bennich in uppsala sweden their joint paper was published in april radiometric assays include the radioallergosorbent test rast test method which uses igebinding antiige antibodies labeled with radioactive isotopes for quantifying the levels of ige antibody in the blood other newer methods use colorimetric or fluorescencelabeled technology in the place of radioactive isotopescitation neededthe rast methodology was invented and marketed in  by pharmacia diagnostics ab uppsala sweden and the acronym rast is actually a brand name in  pharmacia diagnostics ab replaced it with a superior test named the immunocap specific ige blood test which uses the newer fluorescencelabeled technologycitation neededamerican college of allergy asthma and immunology acaai and the american academy of allergy asthma and immunology aaaai issued the joint task force report pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing in  and is firm in its statement that the term rast is now obsoletethe term rast became a colloquialism for all varieties of in vitro allergy tests this is unfortunate because it is well recognized that there are wellperforming tests and some that do not perform so well yet they are all called rasts making it difficult to distinguish which is which for these reasons it is now recommended that use of rast as a generic descriptor of these tests be abandonedthe updated version the immunocap specific ige blood test is the only specific ige assay to receive food and drug administration approval to quantitatively report to its detection limit of kulcitation neededan allergist is a physician specially trained to manage and treat allergies

eosinophilic diseases', 'Altitude sickness': 'altitude sickness the mildest form being acute mountain sickness ams is the harmful effect of high altitude caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation people can respond to high altitude in different ways symptoms may include headaches vomiting tiredness confusion trouble sleeping and dizziness acute mountain sickness can progress to highaltitude pulmonary edema hape with associated shortness of breath or highaltitude cerebral edema hace with associated confusion chronic mountain sickness may occur after longterm exposure to high altitudealtitude sickness typically occurs only above  metres  ft though some are affected at lower altitudes risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness a high degree of activity and a rapid increase in elevation diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities it is recommended that at high altitude any symptoms of headache nausea shortness of breath or vomiting be assumed to be altitude sicknesssickness is prevented by gradually increasing elevation by no more than  metres  ft per day being physically fit does not decrease the risk generally descent and sufficient fluid intake can treat symptoms mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen acetazolamide or dexamethasone severe cases may benefit from oxygen therapy and a portable hyperbaric bag may be used if descent is not possible treatment efforts however have not been well studiedams occurs in about  of people after rapidly going to  metres  ft and  of people going to  metres  ft while ams and hace occurs equally frequently in males and females hape occurs more often in males the earliest description of altitude sickness is attributed to a chinese text from around  bce which describes big headache mountains possibly referring to the karakoram mountains around kilik passpeople have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness for some otherwise healthy people acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around  metres  ft above sea level such as at many mountain ski resorts equivalent to a pressure of  kilopascals  atm this is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered symptoms often manifest within ten hours of ascent and generally subside within two days though they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions symptoms include headache confusion fatigue stomach illness dizziness and sleep disturbance exertion may aggravate the symptomscitation neededthose individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of endtidal pco the lowest concentration of carbon dioxide at the end of the respiratory cycle a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high endtidal pco and low oxygen saturation levelsheadaches are the primary symptom used to diagnose altitude sickness although a headache is also a symptom of dehydrationcitation needed a headache occurring at an altitude above  metres  ft – a pressure of  kilopascals  atm – combined with any one or more of the following symptoms may indicate altitude sicknesssymptoms that may indicate lifethreatening altitude sickness includethe most serious symptoms of altitude sickness arise from edema fluid accumulation in the tissues of the body at very high altitude humans can get either highaltitude pulmonary edema hape or highaltitude cerebral edema hace the physiological cause of altitudeinduced edema is not conclusively established it is currently believed however that hace is caused by local vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels in response to hypoxia resulting in greater blood flow and consequently greater capillary pressures on the other hand hape may be due to general vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation normally a response to regional ventilationperfusion mismatches which with constant or increased cardiac output also leads to increases in capillary pressures for those with hace dexamethasone may provide temporary relief from symptoms in order to keep descending under their own powercitation neededhape can progress rapidly and is often fatal symptoms include fatigue severe dyspnea at rest and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink frothy sputum descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of hapehace is a lifethreatening condition that can lead to coma or death symptoms include headache fatigue visual impairment bladder dysfunction bowel dysfunction loss of coordination paralysis on one side of the body and confusion descent to lower altitudes may save those affected by hacealtitude sickness can first occur at  metres  ft with the effects becoming severe at extreme altitudes greater than  metres  ft only brief trips above  metres  ft are possible and supplemental oxygen is needed to avert sicknessas altitude increases the available amount of oxygen to sustain mental and physical alertness decreases with the overall air pressure though the relative percentage of oxygen in air at about  remains practically unchanged up to  metres  ft the rms velocities of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen are very similar and thus no change occurs in the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen until stratospheric heightsdehydration due to the higher rate of water vapor lost from the lungs at higher altitudes may contribute to the symptoms of altitude sicknessthe rate of ascent altitude attained amount of physical activity at high altitude as well as individual susceptibility are contributing factors to the onset and severity of highaltitude illnessaltitude sickness usually occurs following a rapid ascent and can usually be prevented by ascending slowly in most of these cases the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude acclimatization occurs however in extreme cases altitude sickness can be fatalhigh altitude illness can be classified according to the altitude high – metres – ft very high – metres – ft and extreme above  metres  ftat high altitude  to  metres  to  ft the onset of physiological effects of diminished inspiratory oxygen pressure pio includes decreased exercise performance and increased ventilation lower arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco while arterial oxygen transport may be only slightly impaired the arterial oxygen saturation sao generally stays above  altitude sickness is common between  and  metres  and  ft because of the large number of people who ascend rapidly to these altitudesat very high altitude  to  metres  to  ft maximum sao falls below  as the arterial po falls below mmhg extreme hypoxemia may occur during exercise during sleep and in the presence of high altitude pulmonary edema or other acute lung conditions severe altitude illness occurs most commonly in this rangeabove  metres  ft marked hypoxemia hypocapnia and alkalosis are characteristic of extreme altitudes progressive deterioration of physiologic function eventually outstrips acclimatization as a result no permanent human habitation occurs above  metres  ft a period of acclimatization is necessary when ascending to extreme altitude abrupt ascent without supplemental oxygen for other than brief exposures invites severe altitude sicknessthe physiology of altitude sickness centres around the alveolar gas equation the atmospheric pressure is low but there is still  oxygen water vapour still occupies the same pressure too—this means that there is less oxygen pressure available in the lungs and blood compare these two equations comparing the amount of oxygen in blood at altitudethe hypoxia leads to an increase in minute ventilation hence both low co and subsequently bicarbonate hb increases through haemoconcentration and erythrogenesis alkalosis shifts the haemoglobin dissociation constant to the left bpg increases to counter this cardiac output increases through an increase in heart ratethe bodys response to high altitude includes the followingpeople with highaltitude sickness generally have reduced hyperventilator response impaired gas exchange fluid retention or increased sympathetic drive there is thought to be an increase in cerebral venous volume because of an increase in cerebral blood flow and hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction causing oedemaaltitude sickness is typically selfdiagnosed since symptoms are consistent nausea vomiting headache and can generally be deduced from a rapid change in altitude or oxygen levels however some symptoms may be confused with dehydration some severe cases may require professional diagnosis which can be assisted with multiple different methods such as using an mri or ct scan to check for abnormal buildup of fluids in the lung or brainascending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing hiking etc in the first  hours at high altitude may reduce the symptoms of ams alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates ams thus avoiding alcohol consumption in the first – hours at a higher altitude is optimalpreacclimatization is when the body develops tolerance to low oxygen concentrations before ascending to an altitude it significantly reduces risk because less time has to be spent at altitude to acclimatize in the traditional way additionally because less time has to be spent on the mountain less food and supplies have to be taken up several commercial systems exist that use altitude tents so called because they mimic altitude by reducing the percentage of oxygen in the air while keeping air pressure constant to the surroundings examples of preacclimation measures include remote ischaemic preconditioning using hypobaric air breathing in order to simulate altitude and positive endexpiratory pressurealtitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at higher elevations in order to avoid altitude sickness once above approximately  metres  ft – a pressure of  kilopascals  atm – most climbers and highaltitude trekkers take the climbhigh sleeplow approach for highaltitude climbers a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp climb up to a higher camp slowly and then return to base camp a subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay this process is then repeated a few times each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells once the climber has acclimatized to a given altitude the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations the rule of thumb is to ascend no more than  m  ft per day to sleep that is one can climb from  m  ft  kpa or  atm to  m  ft  kpa or  atm in one day but one should then descend back to  m  ft  kpa or  atm to sleep this process cannot safely be rushed and this is why climbers need to spend days or even weeks at times acclimatizing before attempting to climb a high peak simulated altitude equipment such as altitude tents provide hypoxic reduced oxygen air and are designed to allow partial preacclimation to high altitude reducing the total time required on the mountain itselfaltitude acclimatization is necessary for some people who move rapidly from lower altitudes to higher altitudesthe drug acetazolamide trade name diamox may help some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above  metres  ft and it may also be effective if started early in the course of ams acetazolamide can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of  mg twice daily the everest base camp medical centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations the centre suggests a dosage of  mg twice daily for prophylaxis starting from  hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending with  mg twice daily recommended for treatment of ams the centers for disease control and prevention cdc suggest the same dose for prevention of  mg acetazolamide every  hours acetazolamide a mild diuretic works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine thereby acidifying the blood this change in ph stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration thus speeding the natural acclimatization process an undesirable sideeffect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance other minor side effects include a tinglesensation in hands and feet although a sulfonamide acetazolamide is a nonantibiotic and has not been shown to cause lifethreatening allergic crossreactivity in those with a selfreported sulfonamide allergy dosage of  mgday will produce a  decrease in performance on top of the reduction due to highaltitude exposure the cdc advises that dexamethasone be reserved for treatment of severe ams and hace during descents and notes that nifedipine may prevent hapethere is insufficient evidence to determine the safety of sumatriptan and if it may help prevent altitude sickness despite their popularity antioxidant treatments have not been found to be effective medications for prevention of ams interest in phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen the headache of mountain sickness a promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is myoinositol trispyrophosphate itpp which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobinprior to the onset of altitude sickness ibuprofen is a suggested nonsteroidal antiinflammatory and painkiller that can help alleviate both the headache and nausea associated with ams it has not been studied for the prevention of cerebral edema swelling of the brain associated with extreme symptoms of amsherbal supplements and traditional medicines are sometimes suggested to prevent high altitude sickness including ginkgo biloba r crenulata minerals such as iron antacids and hormonalbased supplements such as medroxyprogesterone and erythropoietin medical evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of these approaches is often contradictory or lacking indigenous peoples of the americas such as the aymaras of the altiplano have for centuries chewed coca leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness this therapy has not yet been proven effective in a clinical study in chinese and tibetan traditional medicine an extract of the root tissue of radix rhodiola is often taken in order to prevent the symptoms of high altitude sickness however no clear medical studies have confirmed the effectiveness or safety of this extractin highaltitude conditions oxygen enrichment can counteract the hypoxia related effects of altitude sickness a small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climatecontrolled rooms at  metres  ft  kpa or  atm raising the oxygen concentration level by  via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of  m  ft  kpa or  atm which is more tolerable for those unaccustomed to high altitudesoxygen from gas bottles or liquid containers can be applied directly via a nasal cannula or mask oxygen concentrators based upon pressure swing adsorption psa vsa or vacuumpressure swing adsorption vpsa can be used to generate the oxygen if electricity is available stationary oxygen concentrators typically use psa technology which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes one way to compensate for the performance degradation is to use a concentrator with more flow capacity there are also portable oxygen concentrators that can be used on vehicular dc power or on internal batteries and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to  m  ft the application of highpurity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the fio fraction of inspired oxygenincreased water intake may also help in acclimatization to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin dry air found at altitude although consuming excessive quantities overhydration has no benefits and may cause dangerous hyponatremiathe only reliable treatment and in many cases the only option available is to descend attempts to treat or stabilize the patient in situ at altitude are dangerous unless highly controlled and with good medical facilities however the following treatments have been used when the patients location and circumstances permit', \"Alzheimer's disease\": 'alzheimers disease ad is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens it is the cause of – of cases of dementia the most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events as the disease advances symptoms can include problems with language disorientation including easily getting lost mood swings loss of motivation selfneglect and behavioral issues as a persons condition declines they often withdraw from family and society gradually bodily functions are lost ultimately leading to death although the speed of progression can vary the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine yearsthe cause of alzheimers disease is poorly understood there are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development the strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of apoe other risk factors include a history of head injury clinical depression and high blood pressure the disease process is largely associated with amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles and loss of neuronal connections in the brain a probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal brain aging examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis but this can only take place after death good nutrition physical activity and engaging socially are known to be of benefit generally in aging and these may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and alzheimers in  clinical trials were underway to look at these possibilities there are no medications or supplements that have been shown to decrease riskno treatments stop or reverse its progression though some may temporarily improve symptoms affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance often placing a burden on the caregiver the pressures can include social psychological physical and economic elements exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are often treated with antipsychotics but this is not usually recommended as there is little benefit and an increased risk of early deathas of  there were approximately  million people worldwide with alzheimers disease it most often begins in people over  years of age although up to  of cases are earlyonset affecting those in their s to mids it affects about  of people  years and older and women more often than men the disease is named after german psychiatrist and pathologist alois alzheimer who first described it in  alzheimers financial burden on society is large with an estimated global annual cost of us trillion alzheimers disease is currently ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the united statesthe course of alzheimers is generally described in three stages with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment the three stages are described as early or mild middle or moderate and late or severe the disease is known to target the hippocampus which is associated with memory and this is responsible for the first symptoms of memory impairment as the disease progresses so does the degree of memory impairmentthe first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to aging or stress detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills the clinical criteria for diagnosis of alzheimers disease these early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living the most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new informationsubtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness planning flexibility and abstract thinking or impairments in semantic memory memory of meanings and concept relationships can also be symptomatic of the early stages of alzheimers disease apathy and depression can be seen at this stage with apathy remaining as the most persistent symptom throughout the course of the disease mild cognitive impairment mci is often found to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia mci can present with a variety of symptoms and when memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed amnestic mci and is frequently seen as a prodromal stage of alzheimers disease amnestic mci has a greater than  likelihood of being associated with alzheimersin people with alzheimers disease the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis in a small percentage difficulties with language executive functions perception agnosia or execution of movements apraxia are more prominent than memory problems alzheimers disease does not affect all memory capacities equally older memories of the persons life episodic memory facts learned semantic memory and implicit memory the memory of the body on how to do things such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memorieslanguage problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and decreased word fluency leading to a general impoverishment of oral and written language in this stage the person with alzheimers is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately while performing fine motor tasks such as writing drawing or dressing certain movement coordination and planning difficulties apraxia may be present but they are commonly unnoticed as the disease progresses people with alzheimers disease can often continue to perform many tasks independently but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activitiesprogressive deterioration eventually hinders independence with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions paraphasias reading and writing skills are also progressively lost complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and alzheimers disease progresses so the risk of falling increases during this phase memory problems worsen and the person may fail to recognise close relatives longterm memory which was previously intact becomes impairedbehavioral and neuropsychiatric changes become more prevalent common manifestations are wandering irritability and emotional lability leading to crying outbursts of unpremeditated aggression or resistance to caregiving sundowning can also appear approximately  of people with alzheimers disease develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations anosognosia urinary incontinence can develop these symptoms create stress for relatives and caregivers which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other longterm care facilitiesduring the final stage known as the latestage or severe stage there is complete dependence on caregivers language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words eventually leading to complete loss of speech despite the loss of verbal language abilities people can often understand and return emotional signals although aggressiveness can still be present extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms people with alzheimers disease will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently muscle mass and mobility deteriorates to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves the cause of death is usually an external factor such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia not the disease itselffamilial alzheimers disease is an inherited and uncommon form of alzheimers disease familial ad usually strikes earlier in life defined as before the age of  fad usually implies multiple persons affected in one or more generationmedical citation needed sporadic alzheimers disease or nonfamilial alzheimers disease describes all other cases where genetic risk factors are minor or unclearproteins fail to function normally this disrupts the work of the brain cells affected and triggers a toxic cascade ultimately leading to cell death and later brain shrinkagealzheimers disease is believed to occur when abnormal amounts of amyloid beta aβ accumulating extracellularly as amyloid plaques and tau proteins or intracellularly as neurofibrillary tangles form in the brain affecting neuronal functioning and connectivity resulting in a progressive loss of brain function this altered protein clearance ability is agerelated regulated by brain cholesterol and associated with other neurodegenerative diseasesadvances in brain imaging techniques allow researchers to see the development and spread of abnormal amyloid and tau proteins in the living brain as well as changes in brain structure and function betaamyloid is a fragment of a larger protein when these fragments cluster together a toxic effect appears on neurons and disrupt celltocell communication larger deposits called amyloid plaques are thus further formedtau proteins are responsible in neurons internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials in alzheimers disease the shape of tau proteins is altered and thus organize themselves into structures called neurofibrillary tangles the tangles disrupt the transport system and are toxic to cellsthe cause for most alzheimers cases is still mostly unknown except for – of cases where deterministic genetic differences have been identified several competing hypotheses attempt to explain the underlying cause the two predominant hypotheses are the amyloid beta aβ hypothesis and the cholinergic hypothesisthe oldest hypothesis on which most drug therapies are based is the cholinergic hypothesis which proposes that alzheimers disease is caused by reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine the loss of cholinergic neurons noted in the limbic system and cerebral cortex is a key feature in the progression of alzheimers the  amyloid hypothesis postulated that extracellular amyloid beta aβ deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein app on chromosome  together with the fact that people with trisomy  down syndrome who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of alzheimers disease by  years of age a specific isoform of apolipoprotein apoe is a major genetic risk factor for alzheimers disease while apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid some isoforms are not very effective at this task such as apoe leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brainonly – of alzheimers cases are inherited autosomal dominant these types are known as early onset familial alzheimers disease can have a very early onset and a faster rate of progression early onset familial alzheimers disease can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes those encoding amyloidbeta precursor protein app and presenilins psen and psen most mutations in the app and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called amyloid beta aβ which is the main component of amyloid plaques some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between aβ and the other major forms—particularly aβ—without increasing aβ levels two other genes associated with autosomal dominant alzheimers disease are abca and sorlmost cases of alzheimers are not inherited and are termed sporadic alzheimers disease in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors most cases of sporadic alzheimers disease in contrast to familial alzheimers disease are lateonset alzheimers disease load developing after the age of  years less than  of sporadic alzheimers disease have an earlier onset the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic alzheimers disease is apoeε apoeε is one of four alleles of apolipoprotein e apoe apoe plays a major role in lipidbinding proteins in lipoprotein particles and the epsilon allele disrupts this function between  and  of people with alzheimers disease possess at least one apoeε allele the apoeε allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by  times in homozygotes like many human diseases environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete penetrance for example certain nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of apoeε and incidence or ageofonset for alzheimers disease seen in other human populationsalleles in the trem gene have been associated with a  to  times higher risk of developing alzheimers diseasea japanese pedigree of familial alzheimers disease was found to be associated with a deletion mutation of codon  of app this mutation and its association with alzheimers disease was first reported in  and is known as the osaka mutation only homozygotes with this mutation have an increased risk of developing alzheimers disease this mutation accelerates aβ oligomerization but the proteins do not form the amyloid fibrils that aggregate into amyloid plaques suggesting that it is the aβ oligomerization rather than the fibrils that may be the cause of this disease mice expressing this mutation have all the usual pathologies of alzheimers diseasethe tau hypothesis proposes that tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade in this model hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau as paired helical filaments eventually they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies when this occurs the microtubules disintegrate destroying the structure of the cells cytoskeleton which collapses the neurons transport systema number of studies connect the misfolded amyloid beta and tau proteins associated with the pathology of alzheimers disease as bringing about oxidative stress that leads to chronic inflammation sustained inflammation neuroinflammation is also a feature of other neurodegenerative diseases including parkinsons disease and als spirochete infections have also been linked to dementia dna damages accumulate in ad brains reactive oxygen species may be the major source of this dna damagesleep disturbances are seen as a possible risk factor for inflammation in alzheimers disease sleep problems have been seen as a consequence of alzheimers disease but studies suggest that they may instead be a causal factor sleep disturbances are thought to be linked to persistent inflammation the cellular homeostasis of biometals such as ionic copper iron and zinc is disrupted in alzheimers disease though it remains unclear whether this is produced by or causes the changes in proteins smoking is a significant alzheimers disease risk factor systemic markers of the innate immune system are risk factors for lateonset alzheimers disease exposure to air pollution may be a contributing factor to the development of alzheimers diseaseaccording to one theory dysfunction of oligodendrocytes and their associated myelin during aging contributes to axon damage which in turn generates in amyloid production and tau hyperphosphorylationretrogenesis is a medical hypothesis that just as the fetus goes through a process of neurodevelopment beginning with neurulation and ending with myelination the brains of people with alzheimers disease go through a reverse neurodegeneration process starting with demyelination and death of axons white matter and ending with the death of grey matter likewise the hypothesis is that as infants go through states of cognitive development people with alzheimers disease go through the reverse process of progressive cognitive impairmentthe association with celiac disease is unclear with a  study finding no increase in dementia overall in those with cd while a  review found an association with several types of dementia including alzheimers diseasealzheimers disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions this loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei particularly the locus coeruleus in the pons studies using mri and pet have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with alzheimers disease as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to alzheimers disease and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adultsboth aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in brains of those with alzheimers disease especially in the hippocampus however alzheimers disease may occur without neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex plaques are dense mostly insoluble deposits of betaamyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons tangles neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of the microtubuleassociated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of aging the brains of people with alzheimers disease have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with alzheimers diseasealzheimers disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease a proteopathy caused by the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein into amyloid plaques and tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles in the brain plaques are made up of small peptides – amino acids in length called amyloid beta aβ amyloid beta is a fragment from the larger amyloidbeta precursor protein app a transmembrane protein that penetrates the neurons membrane app is critical to neuron growth survival and postinjury repair in alzheimers disease gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes app to be divided into smaller fragments one of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as amyloid plaquesalzheimers disease is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein every neuron has a cytoskeleton an internal support structure partly made up of structures called microtubules these microtubules act like tracks guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the axon and back a protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated and is therefore called a microtubuleassociated protein in alzheimers disease tau undergoes chemical changes becoming hyperphosphorylated it then begins to pair with other threads creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neurons transport system pathogenic tau can also cause neuronal death through transposable element dysregulationexactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the betaamyloid peptide give rise to the pathology of alzheimers disease is not known the amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of betaamyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cells calcium ion homeostasis induces programmed cell death apoptosis it is also known that aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of alzheimersaffected brains and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neuronsvarious inflammatory processes and cytokines may also have a role in the pathology of alzheimers disease inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease and may be either secondary to tissue damage in alzheimers disease or a marker of an immunological response there is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progressionalterations in the distribution of different neurotrophic factors and in the expression of their receptors such as the brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf have been described in alzheimers diseasealzheimers disease can only be definitively diagnosed with autopsy findings in the absence of autopsy clinical diagnoses of ad are possible or probable based on other findings up to  of those clinically diagnosed with ad may be misdiagnosed and may have pathology suggestive of another condition with symptoms that mimic those of adad is usually clinically diagnosed based on the persons medical history history from relatives and behavioral observations the presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features and the absence of alternative conditions supports the diagnosisneeds update advanced medical imaging with computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri and with singlephoton emission computed tomography spect or positron emission tomography pet can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia moreover it may predict conversion from prodromal stages mild cognitive impairment to alzheimers disease fdaapproved radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agents used in pet for alzheimers disease are florbetapir  flutemetamol  florbetaben  and flortaucipir  because many insurance companies in the united states do not cover this procedure its use in clinical practice is largely limited to clinical trials as of assessment of intellectual functioning including memory testing can further characterise the state of the disease medical organizations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practising physicians definitive diagnosis can only be confirmed with postmortem evaluations when brain material is available and can be examined histologically for senile plaques and neurofibrillary tanglesthere are three sets of criteria for the clinical diagnoses of the spectrum of alzheimers disease the  fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm the national institute on agingalzheimers association niaaa definition as revised in  and the international working group criteria as revised in  three broad time periods which can span decades define the progression of alzheimers disease from the preclinical phase to mild cognitive impairment mci followed by alzheimers disease dementiaeight intellectual domains are most commonly impaired in ad—memory language perceptual skills attention motor skills orientation problem solving and executive functional abilities as listed in the fourth text revision of the dsm dsmivtrthe dsm defines criteria for probable or possible alzheimers for both major and mild neurocognitive disorder major or mild neurocognitive disorder must be present along with at least one cognitive deficit for a diagnosis of either probable or possible ad for major neurocognitive disorder due to alzheimers disease probable alzheimers disease can be diagnosed if the individual has genetic evidence of alzheimers or if two or more acquired cognitive deficits and a functional disability that is not from another disorder are present otherwise possible alzheimers disease can be diagnosed as the diagnosis follows an atypical route for mild neurocognitive disorder due to alzheimers probable alzheimers disease can be diagnosed if there is genetic evidence whereas possible alzheimers disease can be met if all of the following are present no genetic evidence decline in both learning and memory two or more cognitive deficits and a functional disability not from another disorderthe niaaa criteria are used mainly in research rather than in clinical assessments they define alzheimers disease through three major stages preclinical mild cognitive impairment mci and alzheimers dementia diagnosis in the preclinical stage is complex and focuses on asymptomatic individuals the latter two stages describe individuals experiencing symptoms the core clinical criteria for mci is used along with identification of biomarkers predominantly those for neuronal injury mainly taurelated and amyloid beta deposition the core clinical criteria itself rests on the presence of cognitive impairment without the presence of comorbidities the third stage is divided into probable and possible alzheimers disease dementia in probable alzheimers disease dementia there is steady impairment of cognition over time and a memoryrelated or nonmemoryrelated cognitive dysfunction in possible alzheimers disease dementia another causal disease such as cerebrovascular disease is presentneuropsychological tests including cognitive tests such as the mini–mental state examination mmse the montreal cognitive assessment moca and the minicog are widely used to aid in diagnosis of the cognitive impairments in ad these tests may not always be accurate as they lack sensitivity to mild cognitive impairment and can be biased by language or attention problems more comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results particularly in the earliest stages of the diseasefurther neurological examinations are crucial in the differential diagnosis of alzheimers disease and other diseases interviews with family members are used in assessment caregivers can supply important information on daily living abilities and on the decrease in the persons mental function a caregivers viewpoint is particularly important since a person with alzheimers disease is commonly unaware of their deficits many times families have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physiciansupplemental testing can rule out other potentially treatable diagnoses and help avoid misdiagnoses common supplemental tests include blood tests thyroid function tests as well as tests to assess vitamin b levels rule out neurosyphilis and rule out metabolic problems including tests for kidney function electrolyte levels and for diabetes mri or ct scans might also be used to rule out other potential causes of the symptoms – including tumors or strokes delirium and depression can be common among individuals and are important to rule outpsychological tests for depression are used since depression can either be concurrent with alzheimers disease see depression of alzheimer disease an early sign of cognitive impairment or even the causedue to low accuracy the cpibpet scan is not recommended as an early diagnostic tool or for predicting the development of alzheimers disease when people show signs of mild cognitive impairment mci the use of ffdg pet scans as a single test to identify people who may develop alzheimers disease is not supported by evidencethere are no diseasemodifying treatments available to cure alzheimers disease and because of this ad research has focused on interventions to prevent the onset and progression there is no evidence that supports any particular measure in preventing alzheimers and studies of measures to prevent the onset or progression have produced inconsistent results epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between an individuals likelihood of developing ad and modifiable factors such as medications lifestyle and diet there are some challenges in determining whether interventions for alzheimers disease act as a primary prevention method preventing the disease itself or a secondary prevention method identifying the early stages of the disease these challenges include duration of intervention different stages of disease at which intervention begins and lack of standardization of inclusion criteria regarding biomarkers specific for alzheimers disease further research is needed to determine factors that can help prevent alzheimers diseasecardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia hypertension diabetes and smoking are associated with a higher risk of onset and worsened course of ad the use of statins to lower cholesterol may be of benefit in alzheimers antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications in individuals without overt cognitive impairment may decrease the risk of dementia by influencing cerebrovascular pathology more research is needed to examine the relationship with alzheimers disease specifically clarification of the direct role medications play versus other concurrent lifestyle changes diet exercise smoking is neededdepression is associated with an increased risk for alzheimers disease management with antidepressants may provide a preventative measurehistorically longterm usage of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids were thought to be associated with a reduced likelihood of developing alzheimers disease as it reduces inflammation however nsaids do not appear to be useful as a treatment additionally because women have a higher incidence of alzheimers disease than men it was once thought that estrogen deficiency during menopause was a risk factor however there is a lack of evidence to show that hormone replacement therapy hrt in menopause decreases risk of cognitive declineplantmade metallochaperones could be a novel approach for the treatment of alzheimers diseasecertain lifestyle activities such as physical and cognitive exercises higher education and occupational attainment cigarette smoking stress sleep and the management of other comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension may affect the risk of developing alzheimersphysical exercise is associated with a decreased rate of dementia and is effective in reducing symptom severity in those with ad memory and cognitive functions can be improved with aerobic exercises including brisk walking three times weekly for forty minutes it may also induce neuroplasticity of the brain participating in mental exercises such as reading crossword puzzles and chess have shown a potential to be preventative meeting the who recommendations for physical activity is associated with a lower risk of adhigher education and occupational attainment and participation in leisure activities contribute to a reduced risk of developing alzheimers or of delaying the onset of symptoms this is compatible with the cognitive reserve theory which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations education delays the onset of alzheimers disease syndrome without changing the duration of the diseasecessation in smoking may reduce risk of developing alzheimers disease specifically in those who carry apoe ɛ allele the increased oxidative stress caused by smoking results in downstream inflammatory or neurodegenerative processes that may increase risk of developing ad avoidance of smoking counseling and pharmacotherapies to quit smoking are used and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is recommendedalzheimers disease is associated with sleep disorders but the precise relationship is unclear it was once thought that as people get older the risk of developing sleep disorders and ad independently increase but research is examining whether sleep disorders may increase the prevalence of ad one theory is that the mechanisms to increase clearance of toxic substances including aβ are active during sleep with decreased sleep a person is increasing aβ production and decreasing aβ clearance resulting in aβ accumulation receiving adequate sleep approximately – hours every night has become a potential lifestyle intervention to prevent the development of adstress is a risk factor for the development of alzheimers the mechanism by which stress predisposes someone to development of alzheimers is unclear but it is suggested that lifetime stressors may affect a persons epigenome leading to an overexpression or under expression of specific genes although the relationship of stress and alzheimers is unclear strategies to reduce stress and relax the mind may be helpful strategies in preventing the progression or alzheimers disease meditation for instance is a helpful lifestyle change to support cognition and wellbeing though further research is needed to assess longterm effectsthere is no cure for alzheimers disease available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefits but remain palliative in nature treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical psychosocial and caregivingmedications used to treat the cognitive problems of alzheimers disease include four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors tacrine rivastigmine galantamine and donepezil and memantine an nmda receptor antagonist the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are intended for those with mild to severe alzheimers whereas memantine is intended for those with moderate or severe alzheimers disease the benefit from their use is smallreduction in the activity of the cholinergic neurons is a wellknown feature of alzheimers disease acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine ach is broken down thereby increasing the concentration of ach in the brain and combating the loss of ach caused by the death of cholinergic neurons there is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate alzheimers disease and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage the use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of alzheimers disease the most common side effects are nausea and vomiting both of which are linked to cholinergic excess these side effects arise in approximately – of users are mild to moderate in severity and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses less common secondary effects include muscle cramps decreased heart rate bradycardia decreased appetite and weight and increased gastric acid productionglutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors excitotoxicity occurs not only in alzheimers disease but also in other neurological diseases such as parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis memantine is a noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist first used as an antiinfluenza agent it acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking nmda receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate memantine has been shown to have a small benefit in the treatment of moderate to severe alzheimers disease reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild including hallucinations confusion dizziness headache and fatigue the combination of memantine and donepezil has been shown to be of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectivenessan extract of ginkgo biloba known as egb  has been used for treating alzheimers and other neuropsychiatric disorders its use is approved throughout europe the world federation of biological psychiatry guidelines lists egb  with the same weight of evidence level b given to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine egb  is the only one that showed improvement of symptoms in both alzheimers disease and vascular dementia egb  may have a role either on its own or as an addon if other therapies prove ineffective a  review concluded that the quality of evidence from clinical trials on ginkgo biloba has been insufficient to warrant its use for treating alzheimers diseaseatypical antipsychotics are modestly useful in reducing aggression and psychosis in people with alzheimers disease but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects such as stroke movement difficulties or cognitive decline when used in the longterm they have been shown to associate with increased mortality stopping antipsychotic use in this group of people appears to be safepsychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behavior emotion cognition or stimulationoriented approachesneeds updatebehavioral interventions attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviors this approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviors such as incontinence there is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behavior problems such as wandering music therapy is effective in reducing behavioral and psychological symptomsemotionoriented interventions include reminiscence therapy validation therapy supportive psychotherapy sensory integration also called snoezelen and simulated presence therapy a cochrane review has found no evidence that this is effective reminiscence therapy rt involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group many times with the aid of photographs household items music and sound recordings or other familiar items from the past a  review of the effectiveness of rt found that effects were inconsistent small in size and of doubtful clinical significance and varied by setting simulated presence therapy spt is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with alzheimers disease there is partial evidence indicating that spt may reduce challenging behaviorsthe aim of cognitionoriented treatments which include reality orientation and cognitive retraining is the reduction of cognitive deficits reality orientation consists of the presentation of information about time place or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them on the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercising mental abilities both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacitiesstimulationoriented treatments include art music and pet therapies exercise and any other kind of recreational activities stimulation has modest support for improving behavior mood and to a lesser extent function nevertheless as important as these effects are the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the persons routinesince alzheimers has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending to their own needs caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the diseaseduring the early and moderate stages modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase safety and reduce caretaker burden examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines the placing of safety locks the labeling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects if eating becomes problematic food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even puréed when swallowing difficulties arise the use of feeding tubes may be required in such cases the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members the use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with alzheimers disease or their caregiversduring the final stages of the disease treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death often with the help of hospicediet may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of alzheimers disease the mediterranean diet and the dash diet are both associated with less cognitive decline a different approach has been to incorporate elements of both of these diets into one known as the mind diet studies of individual dietary components minerals and supplements are conflicting as to whether they prevent ad or cognitive declinethe early stages of alzheimers disease are difficult to diagnose a definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities although the person may still be living independently the symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and noncognitive disturbances eliminating any possibility of independent living especially in the late stages of the diseaselife expectancy of people with alzheimers disease is reduced the normal life expectancy for  to  years old is  to  years for  years old it is  years following alzheimers disease diagnosis it ranges from  to  years for those in their s and early s a loss of  to  years to only about  years or less a loss of  years for those in their sfewer than  of people live more than fourteen years disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment decreased functional level history of falls and disturbances in the neurological examination other coincident diseases such as heart problems diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival while the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger men have a less favourable survival prognosis than womenpneumonia and dehydration are the most frequent immediate causes of death brought by alzheimers disease while cancer is a less frequent cause of death than in the general populationtwo main measures are used in epidemiological studies incidence and prevalence incidence is the number of new cases per unit of persontime at risk usually number of new cases per thousand personyears while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given timeregarding incidence cohort longitudinal studies studies where a diseasefree population is followed over the years provide rates between  and  per thousand personyears for all dementias and – for alzheimers disease which means that half of new dementia cases each year are alzheimers disease advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages every  years after the age of  the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles increasing from  to as much as  per thousand person years females with alzheimers disease are more common than males but this difference is likely due to womens longer life spans when adjusted for age both sexes are affected by alzheimers at equal rates in the united states the risk of dying from alzheimers disease in  was  higher among the nonhispanic white population than among the nonhispanic black population and the hispanic population had a  lower risk than the nonhispanic white population however much alzheimers research remains to be done in minority groups such as the african american and the hispaniclatino populations studies have shown that these groups are underrepresented in clinical trials and do not have the same risk of developing alzheimers when carrying certain genetic risk factors ie apoe compared to their caucasian counterpartsthe prevalence of alzheimers disease in populations is dependent upon factors including incidence and survival since the incidence of alzheimers disease increases with age prevalence depends on the mean age of the population for which prevalence is given in the united states in  alzheimers dementia prevalence was estimated to be  for those in the – age group with the rate increasing to  in the – group and to  in those greater than  prevalence rates in some less developed regions around the globe are lower as the incidence and prevalence are steadily increasing the prevalence itself is projected to triple by clarification needed as of   million people globally have ad with this number expected to increase to  million by the ancient greek and roman philosophers and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia it was not until  that german psychiatrist alois alzheimer identified the first case of what became known as alzheimers disease named after him in a fiftyyearold woman he called auguste d he followed her case until she died in  when he first reported publicly on it during the next five years eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature some of them already using the term alzheimers disease the disease was first described as a distinctive disease by emil kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical delusions and hallucinations and pathological features arteriosclerotic changes contained in the original report of auguste d he included alzheimers disease also named presenile dementia by kraepelin as a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his textbook of psychiatry published on  july for most of the th century the diagnosis of alzheimers disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of  and  who developed symptoms of dementia the terminology changed after  when a conference on alzheimers disease concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes this eventually led to the diagnosis of alzheimers disease independent of age the term senile dementia of the alzheimer type sdat was used for a time to describe the condition in those over  with classical alzheimers disease being used to describe those who were younger eventually the term alzheimers disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern disease course and neuropathologythe national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke nincds and the alzheimers disease and related disorders association adrda now known as the alzheimers association established the most commonly used nincdsadrda alzheimers criteria for diagnosis in  extensively updated in  these criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment and a suspected dementia syndrome be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable alzheimers disease a histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmationdementia and specifically alzheimers disease may be among the most costly diseases for societies worldwide as populations age these costs will probably increase and become an important social problem and economic burden costs associated with ad include direct and indirect medical costs which vary between countries depending on social care for a person with ad direct costs include doctor visits hospital care medical treatments nursing home care specialized equipment and household expenses indirect costs include the cost of informal care and the loss in productivity of informal caregiversin the united states as of  informal family care is estimated to constitute nearly threefourths of caregiving for people with ad at a cost of us billion per year and approximately  billion hours of care the cost to society worldwide to care for individuals with ad is projected to increase nearly tenfold and reach about us trillion by costs for those with more severe dementia or behavioral disturbances are higher and are related to the additional caregiving time to provide physical carethe role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative alzheimers disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social psychological physical or economic aspects home care is usually preferred by people with alzheimers disease and their families this option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care nevertheless twothirds of nursing home residents have dementiasdementia caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and mental disorders factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home the carer being a spouse demanding behaviors of the cared person such as depression behavioral disturbances hallucinations sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation regarding economic problems family caregivers often give up time from work to spend  hours per week on average with the person with alzheimers disease while the costs of caring for them are high direct and indirect costs of caring for somebody with alzheimers average between  and  per year in the united states depending on the studycognitive behavioral therapy and the teaching of coping strategies either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers psychological healthalzheimers disease has been portrayed in films such as iris  based on john bayleys memoir of his wife iris murdoch the notebook  based on nicholas sparkss  novel of the same name a moment to remember  thanmathra  memories of tomorrow ashita no kioku  based on hiroshi ogiwaras novel of the same name away from her  based on alice munros short story the bear came over the mountain still alice  about a columbia university professor who has early onset alzheimers

barbara loves farewell  both featuring malcolm pointonalzheimers disease has also been portrayed in music by english musician the caretaker in releases such as persistent repetition of phrases  an empty bliss beyond this world  and everywhere at the end of time – paintings depicting the disorder include the late works by american artist william utermohlen who drew selfportraits from  to  as an experiment of showing his disease through artadditional research on the lifestyle effect may provide insight into neuroimaging biomarkers and better understanding of the mechanisms causing both alzheimers disease and earlyonset adalzheimers disease is associated with neuroinflammation and loss of function of microglia the resident immune cells of the central nervous system microglia become progressively dysfunctional following exposure to amyloid plaques and exposure to proinflammatory cytokines eg tnfα ilβ il has been hypothesized to sustain this dysfunction aberrant synaptic pruning via microglial phagocytosis may also contribute to ad pathologythe complement system which is involved in some forms of typical microglial pruning during development is implicated in animal models of ad by way of dysregulation of the activation eg cq cb and terminal eg mac pathways in synapses with proximity to amyloid plaques astrocytes may also contribute to ad pathology via their reactive states under typical conditions astrocytes can surround amyloid beta plaques and can function to remove these species which may be dysregulated under pathological conditions additionally the activation of astrocytes following the release of apoe has been found to be vitally important in microglia function especially in their ability to remove amyloid beta in ad disease pathology atrophy of astrocytes may prevent these functions and further contribute to the prevalence of ad pathological species such as amyloid beta plaques machine learning algorithms with electronic health records are being studied as a way to predict ad earlierspecific medications that may reduce the prevalence or progression of ad have been studied the research trials investigating medications generally impact aβ plaques inflammation apoe neurotransmitter receptors neurogenesis epigenetic regulators growth factors and hormones these studies have led to a better understanding of the disease but none identified a prevention strategyantibodies are being developed that may have the ability to alter the disease course by targeting amyloid beta such as donanemab and aducanumab aducanumab was approved by the fda in  but its use and effectiveness remain unclear and controversial although it received fda approval aducanumab failed to show effectiveness in people who already had alzheimers symptoms', 'Antisocial personality disorder': 'antisocial personality disorder aspd or infrequently apd is a personality disorder characterized by a longterm pattern of disregard of or violation of the rights of others as well as a difficulty sustaining longterm relationships lack of empathy and a contemptuous or vindictive attitude are often apparent as well as a history of rulebreaking that can sometimes include lawbreaking manipulation compulsive lying for amusement or personal gain a tendency towards chronic boredom and substance abuse and impulsive and aggressive behavior antisocial behaviors often have their onset before the age of  and in nearly  of aspd cases the subject will develop their first symptoms by age  the prevalence of aspd peaks in people age  to  years old and often decreases in people age  to  years in the united states the rate of antisocial personality disorder in the general population is estimated between  and  percent in a study a random sampling of  newly incarcerated offenders found aspd was present in over  percent of those surveyed one out of    of divorces involves a person affected by aspdpersonality disorders are a class of mental disorders characterized by

adulthood and are associated with significant distress or impairment criteria for diagnosing personality disorders are listed in the fifth chapter of the international classification of diseases icd

statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icdneeds update the primary theoretical distinction between the two is that antisocial personality disorder focuses on observable behaviours while dissocial personality disorder focuses on affective deficits otherwise both manuals provide similar criteria for diagnosing the disorder both have also stated that their diagnoses have been referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy however some researchers have drawn distinctions between the concepts of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy with many researchers arguing that psychopathy is a disorder that overlaps with but is distinguishable from aspdaspd is one of the personality disorders most likely to be associated with addiction this is due to their tendency towards impulsive and reckless decision making which puts them at risk of developing a substance abuse disorder prepulse inhibition deficiencies misuse of oral administrations drug overdoses bloodborne diseases shorter periods of abstinence drug use at earlier ages aggressive behavior impulsivity frequent illegal drug use drug injections and difficult interpersonal relationships substance abuse problems are far more common amongst people with aspd who live in rural environments rather than urban ones there are also gender differences between men and women in regard to substance abuse men who abuse substances are far more likely to have aspd than women who are more likely to have a mood disorder the relationship between substance abuse and aspd can be affected by other personality disorders for example one of the previously mentioned studies found that  of participants who had aspd and alcohol abuse had more than one personality disorder heroin methamphetamine opiates alcohol nicotine cannabis polydrugs cocaine and crack cocaine are some prevalent drugs amongst people with aspd alongside substance abuse patients with aspd are more likely to develop a gambling addictionantisocial personality disorder has been associated with higher levels of impulsivity suicidality and irresponsible behavior usually resulting in heightened levels of aggressive behavior domestic violence illegal drug use pervasive anger and violent crimes this behavior usually has negative effects on their education relationships or job alongside this risky sexual behavior such as having multiple sexual partners seeing prostitutes inconsistently using condoms trading sex for drugs and frequent unprotected sex is also common their impulsive behavior will usually jeopardize their own safety and the safety of othersthe violent and impulsive behavior present in aspd has been correlated with chronic boredom other studies have found that people with aspd tend to describe emotions with ambivalence and experience emotions such as happiness and fear less clearly than others they may also experience emotions such as anger and frustration more frequently and clearly than other emotions people with aspd can have difficulty mentalizing or understanding the mental state of others they also may display a perfectly intact theory of mind or the ability to attribute a mental state to oneself and others but an impaired ability to understand how another individual may be affected by an aggressive action these factors possibly contribute to their aggressive and criminal behavior as well as their empathy deficits despite this they may be adept at social cognition or the ability to process and store information about other people which can contribute to an increased ability to manipulate otherspeople with aspd tend to experience more convictions spend more time in jail and are more likely to be charged with almost any crime however assault and other violent crimes are the most common charges this disorder is also prominent among prisoner populations alongside other conduct problems many people with aspd had conduct disorder in youth a disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of violent criminal defiant and antisocial behavior firesetting and the destruction of others property is also a behavior commonly associated with aspd and impulsivity fire starters with aspd tend to have a history of robbery harassment threatening blackmail and difficulty fulfilling promisespeople with aspd may experience a limited capacity for empathy and can be more interested in benefiting themselves regardless of the expense it has on others they may have no regard for morals social norms and the rights and feelings of others people with antisocial personality disorder may have difficulties in sustaining and maintaining relationships and some have difficulty entering them interpersonal relationships often revolve around the exploitation and abuse of others people with aspd may display arrogance think lowly and negatively of others and have limited remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude towards those they have harmed although behaviors vary in degree individuals with this personality disorder will typically have limited compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure and frequently manipulate and deceive other people while some do so through a façade of superficial charm others do so through intimidation and violence it is possible that people with aspd may have intact cognitive empathy but with a deficient theory of mind studies have found that people with aspd have difficulty understanding others emotions and mental states it also may be possible that people with aspd do not lack empathy but are less inclined to use itaspd commonly coexists with the following conditionswhen combined with alcoholism people may show frontal function deficits on neuropsychological tests greater than those associated with each condition alcohol use disorder is likely caused by lack of impulse and behavioral control exhibited by antisocial personality disorder patients the rates of aspd tends to register around – in male alcohol and opiate addicts however it is important to remember this is not a causal relationship but rather a plausible consequence of cognitive deficits as a result of aspdpersonality disorders are seen to be caused by a combination and interaction of genetic and environmental influences genetically it is the intrinsic temperamental tendencies as determined by their genetically influenced physiology and environmentally it is the social and cultural experiences of a person in childhood and adolescence encompassing their family dynamics peer influences and social values people with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are considered to be at higher risk firesetting and cruelty to animals during childhood are also linked to the development of antisocial personality the condition is more common in males than in females and among incarcerated populations although the causes listed correlate to the risk of developing aspd it’s imperative to note that merely one factor is unlikely to be the only cause associated with aspd and relating to a listed cause does not necessarily mean that a person should identify themselves with having aspd research into genetic associations in antisocial personality disorder suggests that aspd has some or even a strong genetic basis prevalence of aspd is higher in people related to someone with the disorder twin studies which are designed to discern between genetic and environmental effects have reported significant genetic influences on antisocial behavior and conduct disorderin the specific genes that may be involved one gene that has seen particular interest in its correlation with antisocial behavior is the gene that encodes for monoamine oxidase a maoa an enzyme that breaks down monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine various studies examining the genes relationship to behavior have suggested that variants of the gene that results in less maoa being produced such as the r and r alleles of the promoter region have associations with aggressive behavior in men the association is also influenced by negative experience in early life with children possessing a lowactivity variant maoal who experience such maltreatment being more likely to develop antisocial behavior than those with the highactivity variant maoah even when environmental interactions eg emotional abuse are controlled for a small association between maoal and aggressive and antisocial behavior remainsthe gene that encodes for the serotonin transporter scla a gene that is heavily researched for its associations with other mental disorders is another gene of interest in antisocial behavior and personality traits genetic associations studies have suggested that the short s allele is associated with impulsive antisocial behavior and aspd in the inmate population however research into psychopathy find that the long l allele is associated with the factor  traits of psychopathy which describes its core affective eg lack of empathy fearlessness and interpersonal eg grandiosity manipulativeness personality disturbances this is suggestive of two different forms one associated more with impulsive behavior and emotional dysregulation and the other with predatory aggression and affective disturbance of the disordervarious other gene candidates for aspd have been identified by a genomewide association study published in  several of these gene candidates are shared with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder with which aspd is comorbid furthermore the study found that those who carry four mutations on chromosome  are  percent more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder than those who do nottraumatic events can lead to a disruption of the standard development of the central nervous system which can generate a release of hormones that can change normal patterns of development aggressiveness and impulsivity are among the possible symptoms of aspd testosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in aggressiveness in the brain for instance criminals who have committed violent crimes tend to have higher levels of testosterone than the average person the effect of testosterone is counteracted by cortisol which facilitates the cognitive control of impulsive tendenciesone of the neurotransmitters that has been discussed in individuals with aspd is serotonin also known as ht a metaanalysis of  studies found significantly lower hiaa levels indicating lower serotonin levels especially in those who are younger than  years of agewhile it has been shown that lower levels of serotonin may be associated with aspd there has also been evidence that decreased serotonin function is highly correlated with impulsiveness and aggression across a number of different experimental paradigms impulsivity is not only linked with irregularities in ht metabolism but may be the most essential psychopathological aspect linked with such dysfunction correspondingly the dsm classifies impulsivity or failure to plan ahead and irritability and aggressiveness as two of seven subcriteria in category a of the diagnostic criteria of aspdsome studies have found a relationship between monoamine oxidase a and antisocial behavior including conduct disorder and symptoms of adult aspd in maltreated childrenantisocial behavior may be related to head trauma antisocial behavior is associated with decreased grey matter in the right lentiform nucleus left insula and frontopolar cortex increased volumes have been observed in the right fusiform gyrus inferior parietal cortex right cingulate gyrus and post central cortexintellectual and cognitive ability is often found to be impaired or reduced in the aspd population contrary to stereotypes in popular culture of the psychopathic genius antisocial personality disorder is associated with both reduced overall intelligence and specific reductions in individual aspects of cognitive ability these deficits also occur in generalpopulation samples of people with antisocial traits and in children with the precursors to antisocial personality disorderpeople that exhibit antisocial behavior tend to demonstrate decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex the association is more apparent in functional neuroimaging as opposed to structural neuroimaging the prefrontal cortex is involved in many executive functions including behavior inhibitions planning ahead determining consequences of action and differentiating between right and wrong however some investigators have questioned whether the reduced volume in prefrontal regions is associated with antisocial personality disorder or whether they result from comorbid disorders such as substance use disorder or childhood maltreatment moreover it remains an open question whether the relationship is causal ie whether the anatomical abnormality causes the psychological and behavioral abnormality or vice versacavum septi pellucidi csp is a marker for limbic neural maldevelopment and its presence has been loosely associated with certain mental disorders such as schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder one study found that those with csp had significantly higher levels of antisocial personality psychopathy arrests and convictions compared with controlsmany studies suggest that the social and home environment has contributed to the development of antisocial behavior the parents of these children have been shown to display antisocial behavior which could be adopted by their children a lack of parental stimulation and affection during early development leads to high levels of cortisol with the absence of balancing hormones such as oxytocin which disrupts and overloads the childs stress response systems which is thought to lead to underdevelopment of the childs brain that deals with emotion empathy and ability to connect to other humans on an emotional level according to dr bruce perry in his book the boy who was raised as a dog the infants developing brain needs patterned repetitive stimuli to develop properly spastic unpredictable relief from fear loneliness discomfort and hunger keeps a babys stress system on high alert an environment of intermittent care punctuated by total abandonment may be the worst of all worlds for a childaspd is highly correlated with emotional and physical abuse in childhood physical neglect has a significant correlation to aspd the way a child bonds with the parents in early life is important poor parental bonding due to abuse puts children at greater risk for developing antisocial personality disorder there is a significant correlation with paternal overprotection and people who develop aspdthe sociocultural perspective of clinical psychology views disorders as influenced by cultural aspects since cultural norms differ significantly mental disorders such as aspd are viewed differently robert d hare has suggested that the rise in aspd that has been reported in the united states may be linked to changes in cultural mores the latter serving to validate the behavioral tendencies of many individuals with aspd\\u200a\\u200a while the rise reported may be in part merely a byproduct of the widening use and abuse of diagnostic techniques given eric bernes division between individuals with active and latent aspd – the latter keeping themselves in check by attachment to an external source of control like the law traditional standards or religion – it has been suggested that the erosion of collective standards may indeed serve to release the individual with latent aspd from their previously prosocial behavior\\u200a–there is also a continuous debate as to the extent to which the legal system should be involved in the identification and admittance of patients with preliminary symptoms of aspd controversial clinical psychiatrist pierreédouard carbonneau suggested that the problem with legal forced admittance is the rate of failure when diagnosing aspd he contends that the possibility of diagnosing and coercing a patient into prescribing medication to someone without aspd but is diagnosed with aspd could be potentially disastrous but the possibility of not diagnosing aspd and seeing a patient go untreated because of a lack of sufficient evidence of cultural or environmental influences is something a psychiatrist must ignore and in his words play it safewhile antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed in adulthood it has its precedent in childhood the dsms criteria for aspd require that the individual have conduct problems evident by the age of  persistent antisocial behavior as well as a lack of regard for others in childhood and adolescence is known as conduct disorder and is the precursor of aspd about – of youths with conduct disorder will be diagnosed with aspd in adulthoodconduct disorder cd is a disorder diagnosed in childhood that parallels the characteristics found in aspd and is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major ageappropriate norms are violated children with the disorder often display impulsive and aggressive behavior may be callous and deceitful and may repeatedly engage in petty crime such as stealing or vandalism or get into fights with other children and adults this behavior is typically persistent and may be difficult to deter with threat or punishment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is common in this population and children with the disorder may also engage in substance use cd is differentiated from oppositional defiant disorder odd in that children with odd do not commit aggressive or antisocial acts against other people animals and property though many children diagnosed with odd are subsequently rediagnosed with cdtwo developmental courses for cd have been identified based on the age at which the symptoms become present the first is known as the childhoodonset type and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of  years this course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors and children in this group express greater levels of adhd symptoms neuropsychological deficits more academic problems increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence the second is known as the adolescentonset type and occurs when conduct disorder develops after the age of  years compared to the childhoodonset type less impairment in various cognitive and emotional functions are present and the adolescentonset variety may remit by adulthood in addition to this differentiation the dsm provides a specifier for a callous and unemotional interpersonal style which reflects characteristics seen in psychopathy and are believed to be a childhood precursor to this disorder compared to the adolescentonset subtype the childhoodonset subtype especially if callous and unemotional traits are present tends to have a worse treatment outcomethe main text of fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm defines antisocial personality disorder as being characterized by at least three of the following traitsin order to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder under the dsm one must be at least  years old show evidence of onset of conduct disorder before age  and antisocial behavior cannot be explained by schizophrenia or bipolar disorderin response to criticisms of the extant section iidsmiv criteria for personality disorders including their discordance with current models in the scientific literature high comorbidity rate overuse of some categories and underuse of others and overwhelming use of the personality disordernot otherwise specified pdnos diagnosis the dsm workgroup on personality disorders devised a dimensional model wherein categoric personality diagnoses reflect extreme variations of normal personality traitsin response to criticisms of the extant section iidsmiv criteria for aspd namely its failure to capture the interpersonal and affective features of psychopathy new criteria were proposedin addition to the new criteria the individual must be at least  years old the traits must cause dysfunction or distress and should not be better explained by another mental disorder the pathophysiological effects of a substance or a persons cultural or social background also included as a with psychopathic traits specifier modelled after the fearless dominance scale of the psychopathic personality inventory defined by low anxiousness and withdrawal and high attentionseeking researchers have also proposed the inclusion of grandiosity and restricted affectivity to better capture psychopathypsychopathy is commonly defined as a personality disorder characterized partly by antisocial behavior a diminished capacity for empathy and remorse and poor behavioral controls psychopathic traits are assessed using various measurement tools including canadian researcher robert d hares psychopathy checklist revised pclr psychopathy is not the official title of any diagnosis in the dsm or icd nor is it an official title used by other major psychiatric organizations the dsm and icd however state that their antisocial diagnoses are at times referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathyamerican psychiatrist hervey cleckleys work on psychopathy formed the basis of the diagnostic criteria for aspd and the dsm states aspd is often referred to as psychopathy however critics argue aspd is not synonymous with psychopathy as the diagnostic criteria are not the same since criteria relating to personality traits are emphasized relatively less in the former these differences exist in part because it was believed such traits were difficult to measure reliably and it was easier to agree on the behaviors that typify a disorder than on the reasons why they occuralthough the diagnosis of aspd covers two to three times as many prisoners than the diagnosis of psychopathy robert hare believes the pclr is better able to predict future criminality violence and recidivism than a diagnosis of aspd he suggests there are differences between pclrdiagnosed psychopaths and nonpsychopaths on processing and use of linguistic and emotional information while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with aspd and without additionally hare argued confusion regarding how to diagnose aspd confusion regarding the difference between aspd and psychopathy as well as the differing future prognoses regarding recidivism and treatability may have serious consequences in settings such as court cases where psychopathy is often seen as aggravating the crimenonetheless psychopathy has been proposed as a specifier under an alternative model for aspd in the dsm under alternative dsm model for personality disorders aspd with psychopathic features is described as characterized by a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors eg fraudulence low levels of withdrawal and high levels of attentionseeking combined with low anxiety are associated with social potency and stress immunity in psychopathy\\u200a\\u200a under the specifier affective and interpersonal characteristics are comparatively emphasized over behavioral components research suggests that even without the with psychopathic traits specifier these section iii criteria accurately capture the affectiveinterpersonal features of psychopathy though the specifier increases coverage of the interpersonal and lifestyle facets of the pclrtheodore millon suggested  subtypes of aspd however these constructs are not recognized in the dsm and icdelsewhere millon differentiates ten subtypes partially overlapping with the above – covetous risktaking malevolent tyrannical malignant disingenuous explosive and abrasive – but specifically stresses that the number  is by no means special  taxonomies may be put forward at levels that are more coarse or more finegrained\\u200aaspd is considered to be among the most difficult personality disorders to treatverification needed rendering an effective treatment for aspd is further complicated due to the inability to look at comparative studies between psychopathy and aspd due to differing diagnostic criteria differences in defining and measuring outcomes and a focus on treating incarcerated patients rather than those in the community because of their very low or absent capacity for remorse individuals with aspd often lack sufficient motivation and fail to see the costs associated with antisocial acts they may only simulate remorse rather than truly commit to change they can be seductively charming and dishonest and may manipulate staff and fellow patients during treatmentverification needed studies have shown that outpatient therapy is not likely to be successful but the extent to which persons with aspd are entirely unresponsive to treatment may have been exaggeratedmost treatment done is for those in the criminal justice system to whom the treatment regimes are given as part of their imprisonment those with aspd may stay in treatment only as required by an external source such as parole conditionsverification needed residential programs that provide a carefully controlled environment of structure and supervision along with peer confrontation have been recommended there has been some research on the treatment of aspd that indicated positive results for therapeutic interventions psychotherapy also known as talk therapy has been found to help treat patients with aspd schema therapy is also being investigated as a treatment for aspd a review by charles m borduin features the strong influence of multisystemic therapy mst that could potentially improve this issue however this treatment requires complete cooperation and participation of all family members some studies have found that the presence of aspd does not significantly interfere with treatment for other disorders such as substance use although others have reported contradictory findingstherapists working with individuals with aspd may have considerable negative feelings toward patients with extensive histories of aggressive exploitative and abusive behaviors rather than attempt to develop a sense of conscience in these individuals which is extremely difficult considering the nature of the disorder therapeutic techniques are focused on rational and utilitarian arguments against repeating past mistakes these approaches would focus on the tangible material value of prosocial behavior and abstaining from antisocial behavior however the impulsive and aggressive nature of those with this disorder may limit the effectiveness of this form of therapythe use of medications in treating antisocial personality disorder is still poorly explored and no medications have been approved by the fda to specifically treat aspd a  cochrane review of studies that explored the use of pharmaceuticals in aspd patients of which eight studies met the selection criteria for review concluded that the current body of evidence was inconclusive for recommendations concerning the use of pharmaceuticals in treating the various issues of aspd nonetheless psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics antidepressants and mood stabilizers can be used to control symptoms such as aggression and impulsivity as well as treat disorders that may cooccur with aspd for which medications are indicatedcitation neededaccording to professor emily simonoff of the institute of psychiatry psychology and neuroscience there are many variables that are consistently connected to aspd such as childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder criminality in adulthood lower iq scores and reading problems the strongest relationship between these variables and aspd are childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder additionally children who grow up with a predisposition of aspd and interact with other delinquent children are likely to later be diagnosed with aspd like many disorders genetics play a role in this disorder but the environment holds an undeniable role in its developmentboys are almost twice as likely to meet all of the diagnostic criteria for aspd than girls  versus  and they will often start showing symptoms of the disorder much earlier in life children that do not show symptoms of the disease through age  will almost never develop aspd later in life if adults exhibit milder symptoms of aspd it is likely that they never met the criteria for the disorder in their childhood and were consequently never diagnosed overall symptoms of aspd tend to peak in late teens and early twenties but can often reduce or improve through age aspd is ultimately a lifelong disorder that has chronic consequences though some of these can be moderated over time there may be a high variability of the longterm outlook of antisocial personality disorder the treatment of this disorder can be successful but it entails unique difficulties it is unlikely to see rapid change especially when the condition is severe in fact past studies revealed that remission rates were small with up to only  rates of improvement instead of remittance as a result of the characteristics of aspd eg displaying charm in effort of personal gain manipulation patients seeking treatment mandated or otherwise may appear to be cured in order to get out of treatment according to definitions found in the dsm people with aspd can be deceitful and intimidating in their relationships when they are caught doing something wrong they often appear to be unaffected and unemotional about the consequences over time continual behavior that lacks empathy and concern may lead to someone with aspd taking advantage of the kindness of others including his or her therapistwithout proper treatment individuals with aspd could lead a life that brings about harm to themselves or others this can be detrimental to their families and careers those with aspd lack interpersonal skills eg lack of remorse lack of empathy lack of emotionalprocessing skills as a result of the inability to create and maintain healthy relationships due to the lack of interpersonal skills individuals with aspd may find themselves in predicaments such as divorce unemployment homelessness and even premature death by suicide they also see higher rates of committed crime reaching peaks in their late teens and often committing higherseverity crimes in their younger ages of diagnoses comorbidity of other mental illnesses such as depression or substance use disorder is prevalent among patients with aspd people with aspd are also more likely to commit homicides and other crimes those who are imprisoned longer often see higher rates of improvement with symptoms of aspd than others who have been imprisoned for a shorter amount of timeaccording to one study aggressive tendencies show in about  of all male patients diagnosed with aspd about  of the men studied with aspd also showed a prevalence of premeditated aggression based on the evidence in the study the researchers concluded that aggression in patients with aspd is mostly impulsive though there are some longterm evidences of premeditated aggressions it often occurs that those with higher psychopathic traits will exhibit the premeditated aggressions to those around them over the course of a patients life with aspd he or she can exhibit this aggressive behavior and harm those close to him or heradditionally many people especially adults who have been diagnosed with aspd become burdens to their close relatives peers and caretakers harvard medical school recommends that time and resources be spent treating victims who have been affected by someone with aspd because the patient with aspd may not respond to the administered therapies in fact a patient with aspd may only accept treatment when ordered by a court which will make their course of treatment difficult and severe because of the challenges in treatment the patients family and close friends must take an active role in decisions about therapies that are offered to the patient ultimately there must be a group effort to aid the longterm effects of the disorderthe estimated lifetime prevalence of aspd amongst the general population falls within  to  skewed towards men with  and  women as seen in two north american studies and two european studies aspd is more commonly seen in men than in women with men three to five times more likely to be diagnosed with aspd than women the prevalence of aspd is even higher in selected populations like prisons where there is a preponderance of violent offenders it has been found that the prevalence of aspd among prisoners is just under  similarly the prevalence of aspd is higher among patients in alcohol or other drug aod use treatment programs than in the general population suggesting a link between aspd and aod use and dependence as part of the epidemiological catchment area eca study men with aspd were found to be three to five times more likely to excessively use alcohol and illicit substances than those men without aspd while aspd occurs more often in men than women there was found to be increased severity of this substance use in women with aspd in a study conducted with both men and women with aspd women were more likely to misuse substances compared to their male counterpartshomelessness is also common amongst people with aspd a study on  youths of san francisco and  youths in chicago found that  and  of the homeless met the diagnostic criteria for aspd respectively another study on the homeless found that  of participants had aspdindividuals with aspd are at an elevated risk for suicide some studies suggest this increase in suicidality is in part due to the association between suicide and symptoms or trends within aspd such as criminality and substance use offspring of people with aspd are also at risk some research suggests that negative or traumatic experiences in childhood perhaps as a result of the choices a parent with aspd might make can be a predictor of delinquency later on in the childs life additionally with variability between situations children of a parent with aspd may face consequences of delinquency if theyre raised in an environment in which crime and violence is common suicide is a leading cause of death among youth who display antisocial behavior especially when mixed with delinquency incarceration which could come as a consequence of actions from a person with aspd is a predictor for suicide ideation in youththe first version of the dsm in  listed sociopathic personality disturbance this category was for individuals who were considered ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing milieu and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals there were four subtypes referred to as reactions antisocial dyssocial sexual and addiction the antisocial reaction was said to include people who were always in trouble and not learning from it maintaining no loyalties frequently callous and lacking responsibility with an ability to rationalize their behavior the category was described as more specific and limited than the existing concepts of constitutional psychopathic state or psychopathic personality which had had a very broad meaning the narrower definition was in line with criteria advanced by hervey m cleckley from  while the term sociopathic had been advanced by george partridge in  when studying the early environmental influence on psychopaths partridge discovered the correlation between antisocial psychopathic disorder and parental rejection experienced in early childhoodthe dsmii in  rearranged the categories and antisocial personality was now listed as one of ten personality disorders but still described similarly to be applied to individuals who are basically unsocialized in repeated conflicts with society incapable of significant loyalty selfish irresponsible unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences and who tend to blame others and rationalize the manual preface contains special instructions including antisocial personality should always be specified as mild moderate or severe the dsmii warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis and that a group delinquent reaction of childhood or adolescence or social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder should be ruled out first the dyssocial personality type was relegated in the dsmii to dyssocial behavior for individuals who are predatory and follow more or less criminal pursuits such as racketeers dishonest gamblers prostitutes and dope peddlers dsmi classified this condition as sociopathic personality disorder dyssocial type it would later resurface as the name of a diagnosis in the icd manual produced by the who later spelled dissocial personality disorder and considered approximately equivalent to the aspd diagnosisthe dsmiii in  included the full term antisocial personality disorder and as with other disorders there was now a full checklist of symptoms focused on observable behaviors to enhance consistency in diagnosis between different psychiatrists interrater reliability the aspd symptom list was based on the research diagnostic criteria developed from the socalled feighner criteria from  and in turn largely credited to influential research by sociologist lee robins published in  as deviant children grown up however robins has previously clarified that while the new criteria of prior childhood conduct problems came from her work she and coresearcher psychiatrist patricia oneal got the diagnostic criteria they used from lees husband the psychiatrist eli robins one of the authors of the feighner criteria who had been using them as part of diagnostic interviewsthe dsmiv maintained the trend for behavioral antisocial symptoms while noting this pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy sociopathy or dyssocial personality disorder and reincluding in the associated features text summary some of the underlying personality traits from the older diagnoses the dsm has the same diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder the pocket guide to the dsm diagnostic exam suggests that a person with aspd may present with psychopathic features if he or she exhibits a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold efficacious interpersonal style', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder': 'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by excessive amounts of inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity that are pervasive impairing in multiple contexts and otherwise ageinappropriateadhd symptoms arise from executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation is often considered a core symptom in children problems paying attention may result in poor school performance adhd is associated with other neurodevelopmental and mental disorders as well as some nonpsychiatric disorders which can cause additional impairment especially in modern society although people with adhd struggle to focus on tasks they are not particularly interested in completing they are often able to maintain an unusually prolonged and intense level of attention for tasks they do find interesting or rewarding this is known as hyperfocusthe precise causes of adhd are unknown in the majority of cases genetic factors play an important role adhd tends to run in families and has a heritability rate of  toxins and infections

the disorder is overlooked in girls or diagnosed in later life because their symptoms sometimes differ from diagnostic criteria about – of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have adhd in adulthood with  of adults estimated to have adhd which began in childhoodtext–source integrity in adults hyperactivity is usually replaced by inner restlessness and adults often develop coping skills to compensate for their impairments the condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behaviour adhd has a negative impact on patient healthrelated quality of life that may be further exacerbated by or may increase the risk of other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depressionadhd management recommendations vary and usually involve some combination of medications counseling and lifestyle changes the british guideline emphasises environmental modifications and education about adhd for individuals and carers as the first response if symptoms persist parenttraining medication or psychotherapy especially cognitive behavioural therapy can be recommended based on age canadian and american guidelines recommend medications and behavioural therapy together except in preschoolaged children for whom the firstline treatment is behavioural therapy alone stimulant medications are the most effective pharmaceutical treatment although there may be side effects and any improvements will be reverted if medication is ceasedadhd its diagnosis and its treatment have been considered controversial since the s these controversies have involved doctors teachers policymakers parents and the media topics have included causes of adhd and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment adhd is now a wellvalidated clinical diagnosis in children and adults and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated adhd was officially known as attention deficit disorder add from  to  prior to the s it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood symptoms similar to those of adhd have been described in medical literature dating back to the th centuryinattention hyperactivity restlessness in adults disruptive behaviour and impulsivity are common in adhd academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships the symptoms can be difficult to define as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions beginaccording to the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm and its text revision dsmtr symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age this requires at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivityimpulsivity for those under  and at least five symptoms for those  years or older the symptoms must be present in at least two settings eg social school work or home and must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning additionally several symptoms must have been present before age twelveadhd is divided into three primary presentationsthe table symptoms lists the symptoms for adhdi and adhdhi from two major classification systems symptoms which can be better explained by another

inattentive symptoms are predominantthe individual may also meet the criteria for inattention but the hyperactiveimpulsive symptoms are predominantgirls and women with adhd tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms of inattention and distractibilitysymptoms are expressed differently and more subtly as the individual ages\\u200a\\u200a hyperactivity tends to become less overt with age and turns into inner restlessness difficulty relaxing or remaining still talkativeness or constant mental activity in teens and adults with adhd\\u200a–\\u200a impulsivity in adulthood may appear as thoughtless behaviour impatience irresponsible spending and sensationseeking behaviours\\u200a\\u200a while inattention may appear as becoming easily bored difficulty with organization remaining on task and making decisions and sensitivity to stress\\u200aalthough not listed as an official symptom for this condition emotional dysregulation or mood lability is generally understood to be a common symptom of adhd\\u200a\\u200a people with adhd of all ages are more likely to have problems with social skills such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships this is true for all presentations about half of children and adolescents with adhd experience social rejection by their peers compared to – of nonadhd children and adolescents people with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction they also may drift off during conversations miss social cues and have trouble learning social skillsdifficulties managing anger are more common in children with adhd as are delays in speech language and motor development poorer handwriting is more common in children with adhd poor handwriting in many situations can be a side effect of adhd in itself due to decreased attentiveness but when its a constant problem it may also be in part due to both dyslexic and dysgraphic individuals having higher rates of adhd than the general population with  in  people who have dyslexia also having adhd although it causes significant difficulty many children with adhd have an attention span equal to or greater than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interestingin children adhd occurs with other disorders about twothirds of the timeother neurodevelopmental conditions are common comorbidities autism spectrum disorder asd cooccurring at a rate of  in those with adhd affects social skills ability to communicate behaviour and interests both adhd and asd can be diagnosed in the same personpage needed learning disabilities have been found to occur in about – of children with adhd learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders and academic skills disorders adhd however is not considered a learning disability but it very frequently causes academic difficulties intellectual disabilitiespage needed and tourettes syndrome are also commonadhd is often comorbid with disruptive impulse control and conduct disorders oppositional defiant disorder odd occurs in about  of children with an inattentive presentation and  of those with a combined presentationpage needed it is characterised by angry or irritable mood argumentative or defiant behaviour and vindictiveness which are ageinappropriate conduct disorder cd occurs in about  of adolescents with adhdpage needed it is characterised by aggression destruction of property deceitfulness theft and violations of rules adolescents with adhd who also have cd are more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder in adulthood brain imaging supports that cd and adhd are separate conditions wherein conduct disorder was shown to reduce the size of ones temporal lobe and limbic system and increase the size of ones orbitofrontal cortex whereas adhd was shown to reduce connections in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex more broadly conduct disorder involves more impairment in motivation control than adhd intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by sudden and disproportionate outbursts of anger and cooccurs in individuals with adhd more frequently than in the general populationanxiety and mood disorders are frequent comorbidities anxiety disorders have been found to occur more commonly in the adhd population as have mood disorders especially bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder boys diagnosed with the combined adhd subtype are more likely to have a mood disorder adults and children with adhd sometimes also have bipolar disorder which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditionssleep disorders and adhd commonly coexist they can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat adhd in children with adhd insomnia is the most common sleep disorder with behavioural therapy being the preferred treatment problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with adhd but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the morning melatonin is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia specifically the sleep disorder restless legs syndrome has been found to be more common in those with adhd and is often due to iron deficiency anemia however restless legs can simply be a part of adhd and requires careful assessment to differentiate between the two disorders delayed sleep phase disorder is also a common comorbidity of those with adhdthere are other psychiatric conditions which are often comorbid with adhd such as substance use disorders individuals with adhd are at increased risk of substance abuse\\u200a\\u200a this is most commonly seen with alcohol or cannabis\\u200a\\u200a the reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of adhd individuals selftreatment and increased psychosocial risk factors\\u200a\\u200a this makes the evaluation and treatment of adhd more difficult with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks other psychiatric conditions include reactive attachment disorder characterised by a severe inability to appropriately relate socially and sluggish cognitive tempo a cluster of symptoms that potentially comprises another attention disorder and may occur in – of adhd cases regardless of the subtype individuals with adhd are three times more likely to develop and be diagnosed with an eating disorder compared to those without adhd conversely individuals with eating disorders are two times more likely to have adhd than those without eating disordersadhd trauma and adverse childhood experiences are also comorbid which could in part be potentially explained by the similarity in presentation between different diagnoses the symptoms of adhd and ptsd can have significant behavioural overlap—in particular motor restlessness difficulty concentrating distractibility irritabilityanger emotional constriction or dysregulation poor impulse control and forgetfulness are common in both this could result in traumarelated disorders or adhd being misidentified as the other additionally traumatic events in childhood are a risk factor for adhd  it can lead to structural brain changes and the development of adhd behaviours finally the behavioural consequences of adhd symptoms cause a higher chance of the individual experiencing trauma and therefore adhd leads to a concrete diagnosis of a traumarelated disordernonprimary source neededsome nonpsychiatric conditions are also comorbidities of adhd this includes epilepsy a neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures there are well established associations between adhd and obesity asthma and sleep disorders and an association with celiac disease children with adhd have a higher risk for migraine headaches but have no increased risk of tensiontype headaches in addition children with adhd may also experience headaches as a result of medicationa  review reported that several neurometabolic disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism converge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with biological mechanisms also considered central in adhd pathophysiology and treatment this highlights the importance of close collaboration between health services to avoid clinical overshadowingsystematic reviews conducted in  and  found strong evidence that adhd is associated with increased suicide risk across all age groups as well as growing evidence that an adhd diagnosis in childhood or adolescence represents a significant future suicidal risk factor potential causes include adhds association with functional impairment negative social educational and occupational outcomes and financial distress a  metaanalysis indicated a significant association between adhd and suicidal spectrum behaviours suicidal attempts ideations plans and completed suicides across the studies examined the prevalence of suicide attempts in individuals with adhd was  compared to  in individuals without adhd and the findings were substantially replicated among studies which adjusted for other variables however the relationship between adhd and suicidal spectrum behaviours remains unclear due to mixed findings across individual studies and the complicating impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders there is no clear data on whether there is a direct relationship between adhd and suicidality or whether adhd increases suicide risk through comorbiditiescertain studies have found that people with adhd tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient iq tests the significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with adhd and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms such as distractibility on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity in studies of adhd higher iqs may be overrepresented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower iqs despite those with adhd scoring on average nine points lower on standardised intelligence measures in individuals with high intelligence there is increased risk of a missed adhd diagnosis possibly because of compensatory strategies in highly intelligent individualsstudies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problemsadhd is generally claimed to be the result of neurological dysfunction in processes associated with the production or use of dopamine and norepinephrine in various brain structures but there are no confirmed causes it may involve interactions between genetics and the environmentadhd has a high heritability of  meaning that  of the presence of adhd in the population is due to genetic factors there are multiple gene variants which each slightly increase the likelihood of a person having adhd it is polygenic and arises through the combination of many gene variants which each have a small effect the siblings of children with adhd are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorderarousal is related to dopaminergic functioning and adhd presents with low dopaminergic functioning typically a number of genes are involved many of which directly affect dopamine neurotransmission those involved with dopamine include dat drd drd taar maoa comt and dbh other genes associated with adhd include sert htrb snap grina adraa tph and bdnf a common variant of a gene called latrophilin  is estimated to be responsible for about  of cases and when this variant is present people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication the  repeat variant of dopamine receptor d drd–r causes increased inhibitory effects induced by dopamine and is associated with adhd the drd receptor is a g proteincoupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase the drd–r mutation results in a wide range of behavioural phenotypes including adhd symptoms reflecting split attention the drd gene is both linked to novelty seeking and adhd the genes gfod and cdh show strong genetic associations with adhd chds association with asd schizophrenia bipolar disorder and depression make it an interesting candidate causative gene another candidate causative gene that has been identified is adgrl in zebrafish knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in the ventral diencephalon and the fish display a hyperactiveimpulsive phenotypefor genetic variation to be used as a tool for diagnosis more validating studies need to be performed however smaller studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in genes related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission or the snare complex of the synapse can reliably predict a persons response to stimulant medication rare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance the chance of developing the disorder tends to be much higher however their usefulness as tools for diagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts adhd asd shows genetic overlap with adhd at both common and rare levels of genetic variationin addition to genetics some environmental factors might play a role in causing adhd alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include adhd or symptoms like it children exposed to certain toxic substances such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls may develop problems which resemble adhd exposure to the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and dialkyl phosphate is associated with an increased risk however the evidence is not conclusive exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of adhd nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental riskextreme premature birth very low birth weight and extreme neglect abuse or social deprivation also increase the risk as do certain infections during pregnancy at birth and in early childhood these infections include among others various viruses measles varicella zoster encephalitis rubella enterovirus  at least  of children with a traumatic brain injury later develop adhd and about  of cases are due to brain damagesome studies suggest that in a small number of children artificial food dyes or preservatives may be associated with an increased prevalence of adhd or adhdlike symptoms but the evidence is weak and may only apply to children with food sensitivities the european union has put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns in a minority of children intolerances or allergies to certain foods may worsen adhd symptomsindividuals with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation are sometimes diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd raising the possibility that a subtype of adhd has a cause that can be understood mechanistically and treated in a novel way the sensory overload is treatable with oral potassium gluconateresearch does not support popular beliefs that adhd is caused by eating too much refined sugar watching too much television parenting poverty or family chaos however they might worsen adhd symptoms in certain peoplethe youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having adhd possibly due to them being developmentally behind their older classmates one study showed that the youngest children in fifth and eight grade was nearly twice as likely to use stimulant medication than their older peersin some cases an inappropriate diagnosis of adhd may reflect a dysfunctional family or a poor educational system rather than any true presence of adhd in the individualbetter source needed in other cases it may be explained by increasing academic expectations with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some countries to get extra financial and educational support for their child behaviours typical of adhd occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abusecurrent models of adhd suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brains neurotransmitter systems particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine the dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus project to diverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes the dopamine pathways and norepinephrine pathways which project to the prefrontal cortex and striatum are directly responsible for modulating executive function cognitive control of behaviour motivation reward perception and motor function these pathways are known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of adhd larger models of adhd with additional pathways have been proposedin children with adhd there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the leftsided prefrontal cortex the posterior parietal cortex also shows thinning in individuals with adhd compared to controls other brain structures in the prefrontalstriatalcerebellar and prefrontalstriatalthalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without adhdthe subcortical volumes of the accumbens amygdala caudate hippocampus and putamen appears smaller in individuals with adhd compared with controls structural mri studies have also revealed differences in white matter with marked differences in interhemispheric asymmetry between adhd and typically developing youthsfunction mri fmri studies have revealed a number of differences between adhd and control brains mirroring what is known from structural findings fmri studies have showed evidence for a higher connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions such as between the caudate and prefrontal cortex the degree of hyperconnectivity between these regions correlated with the severity of inattention or hyperactivity  hemispheric lateralization processes have also been postulated as being implicated in adhd but empiric results showed contrasting evidence on the topicpreviously it had been suggested that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with adhd was part of the pathophysiology but it appears the elevated numbers may be due to adaptation following exposure to stimulant medication current models involve the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway and the locus coeruleusnoradrenergic system adhd psychostimulants possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems there may additionally be abnormalities in serotonergic glutamatergic or cholinergic pathwaysthe symptoms of adhd arise from a deficiency in certain executive functions eg attentional control inhibitory control and working memory executive functions are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviours that facilitate the attainment of ones chosen goals the executive function impairments that occur in adhd individuals result in problems with staying organised time keeping excessive procrastination maintaining concentration paying attention ignoring distractions regulating emotions and remembering details people with adhd appear to have unimpaired longterm memory and deficits in longterm recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older adhd impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood conversely brain maturation trajectories potentially exhibiting diverging longitudinal trends in adhd may support a later improvement in executive functions after reaching adulthoodadhd has also been associated with motivational deficits in children children with adhd often find it difficult to focus on longterm over shortterm rewards and exhibit impulsive behaviour for shortterm rewardsanother sign of the structurally altered signal processing in the central nervous system in this group of people is the conspicuously common paradoxical reaction c\\u2009– of patients these are unexpected reactions in the opposite direction as with a normal effect or otherwise significant different reactions these are reactions to neuroactive substances such as local anesthetic at the dentist sedative caffeine antihistamine weak neuroleptics and central and peripheral painkillers since the causes of paradoxical reactions are at least partly genetic it may be useful in critical situations for example before operations to ask whether such abnormalities may also exist in family membersadhd is diagnosed by an assessment of a persons behavioural and mental development including ruling out the effects of drugs medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms adhd diagnosis often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns it may be viewed as the extreme end of one or more continuous human traits found in all people imaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals thus they are only used for research purposes and not a diagnosisin north america and australia dsm criteria are used for diagnosis while european countries usually use the icd the dsmiv criteria for diagnosis of adhd is – times more likely to diagnose adhd than is the icd criteria adhd is alternately classified as neurodevelopmental disorder or a disruptive behaviour disorder along with odd cd and antisocial personality disorder a diagnosis does not imply a neurological disorderassociated conditions that should be screened for include anxiety depression odd cd and learning and language disorders other conditions that should be considered are other neurodevelopmental disorders tics and sleep apneaselfrating scales such as the adhd rating scale and the vanderbilt adhd diagnostic rating scale are used in the screening and evaluation of adhd electroencephalography is not accurate enough to make an adhd diagnosisas with many other psychiatric disorders a formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria in the united states these criteria are defined by the american psychiatric association in the dsm based on the dsm criteria published in  and the dsmtr criteria published in  there are three presentations of adhdthis subdivision is based on presence of at least six in children or five in older teenagers and adults out of nine longterm lasting at least six months symptoms of inattention hyperactivity–impulsivity or both to be considered several symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment eg at home and at school or work the symptoms must be inappropriate for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing social school or work related problemsthe dsm and the dsmtr also provide two diagnoses for individuals who have symptoms of adhd but do not entirely meet the requirements other specified adhd allows the clinician to describe why the individual does not meet the criteria whereas unspecified adhd is used where the clinician chooses not to describe the reasonin the eleventh revision of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd by the world health organization the disorder is classified as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with the code a the defined subtypes are similar to those of the dsm predominantly inattentive presentation a predominantly hyperactiveimpulsive presentationa combined presentation a however the icd includes two residual categories for individuals who do not entirely match any of the defined subtypes other specified presentation ay where the clinician includes detail on the individuals presentation and presentation unspecified az where the clinician does not provide detailin the tenth revision icd the symptoms of hyperkinetic disorder were analogous to adhd in the icd when a conduct disorder as defined by icd is present the condition was referred to as hyperkinetic conduct disorder otherwise the disorder was classified as disturbance of activity and attention other hyperkinetic disorders or hyperkinetic disorders unspecified the latter was sometimes referred to as hyperkinetic syndromethe social construct theory of adhd suggests that because the boundaries between normal and abnormal behaviour are socially constructed ie jointly created and validated by all members of society and in particular by physicians parents teachers and others it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and thus the number of people affected this difference means using dsmiv criteria could diagnose adhd at rates three to four times higher than icd criteria thomas szasz a supporter of this theory has argued that adhd was invented and then given a nameadults with adhd are diagnosed under the same criteria including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve the individual is the best source for information in diagnosis however others may provide useful information about the individuals symptoms currently and in childhood a family history of adhd also adds weight to a diagnosis\\u200a\\u200a\\u200a while the core symptoms of adhd are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults\\u200aworldwide it is estimated that  of adults have persistent adhd where the individual currently meets the criteria and there is evidence of childhood onset and  of adults have symptomatic adhd meaning that they currently meet the criteria for adhd regardless of childhood onset in  this was  million and  million affected adults respectively around  of children with adhd continue to meet full dsmivtr criteria at  years of age and  still experience some symptoms\\u200a\\u200a as of  most adults remain untreated many adults with adhd without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganised life and some use nonprescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism other problems may include relationship and job difficulties and an increased risk of criminal activities\\u200a\\u200a associated mental health problems include depression anxiety disorders and learning disabilitiessome adhd symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children while children with adhd may climb and run about excessively adults may experience an inability to relax or may talk excessively in social situations\\u200a\\u200a adults with adhd may start relationships impulsively display sensationseeking behaviour and be shorttempered\\u200a\\u200a addictive behaviour such as substance abuse and gambling are common\\u200a\\u200a this led to those who presented differently as they aged having outgrown the dsmiv criteria\\u200a–\\u200a the dsm criteria does specifically deal with adults unlike that of dsmiv which does not fully take into account the differences in impairments seen in adulthood compared to childhood\\u200afor diagnosis in an adult having symptoms since childhood is required nevertheless a proportion of adults who meet the criteria for adhd in adulthood would not have been diagnosed with adhd as children most cases of lateonset adhd develop the disorder between the ages of  and may therefore be considered early adult or adolescentonset adhdin manic statein depressive statethe dsm provides potential differential diagnoses  potential alternate explanations for specific symptoms assessment and investigation of clinical history determines which is the most appropriate diagnosis the dsm suggests odd intermittent explosive disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders such as stereotypic movement disorder and tourettes disorder in addition to specific learning disorder intellectual developmental disorder asd reactive attachment disorder anxiety disorders depressive disorders bipolar disorder disruptive mood dysregulation disorder substance use disorder personality disorders psychotic disorders medicationinduced symptoms and neurocognitive disorders many but not all of these are also common comorbidities of adhd the dsmtr also suggests posttraumatic stress disordersymptoms of adhd such as low mood and poor selfimage mood swings and irritability can be confused with dysthymia cyclothymia or bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality disorder\\u200a\\u200a some symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders personality disorder developmental disabilities or intellectual disability or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap with adhd these disorders can also sometimes occur along with adhd medical conditions which can cause adhdtype symptoms include hyperthyroidism seizure disorder lead toxicity hearing deficits hepatic disease sleep apnea drug interactions untreated celiac disease and head injurybetter source neededprimary sleep disorders may affect attention and behaviour and the symptoms of adhd may affect sleep it is thus recommended that children with adhd be regularly assessed for sleep problems sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the eyes to hyperactivity and inattentiveness obstructive sleep apnea can also cause adhdtype symptomsthe management of adhd typically involves counseling or medications either alone or in combination while treatment may improve longterm outcomes it does not get rid of negative outcomes entirely medications used include stimulants atomoxetine alpha adrenergic receptor agonists and sometimes antidepressants in those who have trouble focusing on longterm rewards a large amount of positive reinforcement improves task performance adhd stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with adhd recent evidence from observational and registry studies indicates that pharmacological treatment of adhd is associated with increased achievement and decreased absenteeism at school a reduced risk of traumarelated emergency hospital visits reduced risks of suicide and attempted suicide and decreased rates of substance abuse and criminalitythere is good evidence for the use of behavioural therapies in adhd they are the recommended firstline treatment in those who have mild symptoms or who are preschoolaged psychological therapies used include psychoeducational input behavior therapy cognitive behavioral therapy interpersonal psychotherapy family therapy schoolbased interventions social skills training behavioural peer intervention organization training and parent management training neurofeedback has greater treatment effects than nonactive controls for up to  months and possibly a year following treatment and may have treatment effects comparable to active controls controls proven to have a clinical effect over that time period despite efficacy in research there is insufficient regulation of neurofeedback practice leading to ineffective applications and false claims regarding innovations parent training may improve a number of behavioural problems including oppositional and noncompliant behavioursthere is little highquality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for adhd—but the existing evidence shows that it is similar to community care and better than placebo adhdspecific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with adhdsocial skills training behavioural modification and medication may have some limited beneficial effects in peer relationships stable highquality friendships with nondeviant peers protect against later psychological problemsmethylphenidate and amphetamine or its derivatives are firstline treatments for adhd as they are considered the most effective pharmaceutical treatments about  percent respond to the first stimulant tried and as few as  percent respond to neither amphetamines nor methylphenidate stimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in children with adhd magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that longterm treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with adhd a  review found the greatest shortterm benefit with methylphenidate in children and amphetamines in adultsthe likelihood of developing insomnia for adhd patients taking stimulants has been measured at between  and  percent for different medications and may be a main reason for discontinuation other side effects such as tics decreased appetite and weight loss or emotional lability may also lead to discontinuation stimulant psychosis and mania are rare at therapeutic doses appearing to occur in approximately  of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy the safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear symptom improvement is not sustained if medication is ceasedthe longterm effects of adhd medication have yet to be fully determined although stimulants are generally beneficial and safe for up to two years for children and adolescents regular monitoring has been recommended in those on longterm treatment there are indications suggesting that stimulant therapy for children and adolescents should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication decrease possible growth delay and reduce tolerance although potentially addictive at high doses stimulants used to treat adhd have low potential for abuse treatment with stimulants is either protective against substance abuse or has no effect\\u200a\\u200athe majority of studies on nicotine and other nicotinic agonists as treatments for adhd have shown favorable results however no nicotinic drug has been approved for adhd treatment caffeine was formerly used as a secondline treatment for adhd it is considered less effective than methylphenidate or amphetamine but more so than placebo for children with adhd pseudoephedrine and ephedrine do not affect adhd symptomsmodafinil has shown some efficacy in reducing the severity of adhd in children and adolescents it may be prescribed offlabel to treat adhdthere are a number of nonstimulant medications such as viloxazine atomoxetine bupropion guanfacine amantadine effective in children and adolescents but still not been seen for adults and clonidine that may be used as alternatives or added to stimulant therapy there are no good studies comparing the various medications however they appear more or less equal with respect to side effects for children stimulants appear to improve academic performance while atomoxetine does notatomoxetine due to its lack of addiction liability may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use although evidence is lacking to support its use over stimulants for this reason\\u200a\\u200a evidence supports its ability to improve symptoms when compared to placeboamantadine was shown to induce similar improvements in children treated methylphenidate with less frequent side effects a  retrospective study showed showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for adhd–related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second or thirdgeneration antipsychoticsthere is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviours antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in adhdguidelines on when to use medications vary by country the united kingdoms national institute for health and care excellence recommends use for children only in severe cases though for adults medication is a firstline treatment conversely most united states guidelines recommend medications in most age groups medications are especially not recommended for preschool children underdosing of stimulants can occur and can result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness this is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on schoolaged children causing some practitioners to use weightbased or benefitbased offlabel dosing insteadregular physical exercise particularly aerobic exercise is an effective addon treatment for adhd in children and adults particularly when combined with stimulant medication although the best intensity and type of aerobic exercise for improving symptoms are not currently known the longterm effects of regular aerobic exercise in adhd individuals include better behaviour and motor abilities improved executive functions including attention inhibitory control and planning among other cognitive domains faster information processing speed and better memory parentteacher ratings of behavioural and socioemotional outcomes in response to regular aerobic exercise include better overall function reduced adhd symptoms better selfesteem reduced levels of anxiety and depression fewer somatic complaints better academic and classroom behaviour and improved social behaviour exercising while on stimulant medication augments the effect of stimulant medication on executive function it is believed that these shortterm effects of exercise are mediated by an increased abundance of synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine in the braindietary modifications are not recommended as of  by the american academy of pediatrics the national institute for health and care excellence or the agency for healthcare research and quality due to insufficient evidence a  metaanalysis found less than a third of children with adhd see some improvement in symptoms with free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food colouring these benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with adhd medications this review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from the diet to treat adhd a  review found that an elimination diet results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children such as those with allergies a  review stated that the use of a glutenfree diet as standard adhd treatment is not advised a  review showed that a fewfoods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food colouring as standard adhd treatment is not advised chronic deficiencies of iron magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on adhd symptoms there is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue zinc levels may be associated with adhd in the absence of a demonstrated zinc deficiency which is rare outside of developing countries zinc supplementation is not recommended as treatment for adhd however zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of adhdadhd persists into adulthood in about – of cases those affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms children with adhd have a higher risk of unintentional injuries effects of medication on functional impairment and quality of life eg reduced risk of accidents have been found across multiple domains rates of smoking among those with adhd are higher than in the general population at about individuals with adhd are significantly overrepresented in prison populations although there is no generally accepted estimate of adhd prevalence among inmates a  metaanalysis estimated a prevalence of  and a larger  metaanalysis estimated the frequency to be  adhd is more common among longerterm inmates a  study at norrtälje prison a highsecurity prison in sweden found an estimated adhd prevalence of adhd is estimated to affect about – of people aged  and under when diagnosed via the dsmiv criteria when diagnosed via the icd criteria rates in this age group are estimated around – children in north america appear to have a higher rate of adhd than children in africa and the middle east this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequencyverification needed as of  it was estimated to affect  million people globally if the same diagnostic methods are used the rates are similar between countries adhd is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls this may reflect either a true difference in underlying rate or that women and girls with adhd are less likely to be diagnosedrates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the united kingdom and the united states since the s prior to  it was rare for children to be diagnosed with adhd while in the s rates were about  this is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common the condition is it was believed changes to the diagnostic criteria in  with the release of the dsm would increase the percentage of people diagnosed with adhd especially among adultsdue to disparities in the treatment and understanding of adhd between caucasian and noncaucasian populations many noncaucasian children go undiagnosed and unmedicated it was found that within the us that there was often a disparity between caucasian and noncaucasian understandings of adhd this led to a difference in the classification of the symptoms of adhd and therefore its misdiagnosis it was also found that it was common in noncaucasian families and teachers to understand the symptoms of adhd as behavioural issues rather than mental illnesscrosscultural differences in diagnosis of adhd can also be attributed to the longlasting effects of harmful racially targeted medical practices medical pseudosciences particularly those that targeted african american populations during the period of slavery in the us lead to a distrust of medical practices within certain communities the combination of adhd symptoms often being regarded as misbehaviour rather than as a psychiatric condition and the use of drugs to regulate adhd result in a hesitancy to trust a diagnosis of adhd cases of misdiagnosis in adhd can also occur due to stereotyping of noncaucasian individuals due to adhds subjectively determined symptoms medical professionals may diagnose individuals based on stereotyped behaviour or misdiagnose due to differences in symptom presentation between caucasian and noncaucasian individualshyperactivity has long been part of the human condition sir alexander crichton describes mental restlessness in his book an inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement written in  he made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having the fidgets the first clear description of adhd is credited to george still in  during a series of lectures he gave to the royal college of physicians of london he noted both nature and nurture could be influencing this disorderalfred tredgold proposed an association between brain damage and behavioural or learning problems which was able to be validated by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic from  through the terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included minimal brain dysfunction in the dsmi  hyperkinetic reaction of childhood in the dsmii  and attentiondeficit disorder with or without hyperactivity in the dsmiii  in  this was changed to adhd in the dsmiiir and in  the dsmiv in split the diagnosis into three subtypes adhd inattentive type adhd hyperactiveimpulsive type and adhd combined type these terms were kept in the dsm in  and in the dsmtr in  prior to the dsm terms included minimal brain damage in the sin  benzedrine became the first amphetamine medication approved for use in the united states methylphenidate was introduced in the s and enantiopure dextroamphetamine in the s the use of stimulants to treat adhd was first described in  charles bradley gave the children with behavioural disorders benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behaviouronce neuroimaging studies were possible studies conducted in the s provided support for the preexisting theory that neurological differences  particularly in the frontal lobes  were involved in adhd during this same period a genetic component was identified and adhd was acknowledged to be a persistent longterm disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthoodadhd was split into the current three subtypes because of a field trial completed by lahey and colleaguesadhd its diagnosis and its treatment have been controversial since the s the controversies involve clinicians teachers policymakers parents and the media positions range from the view that adhd is within the normal range of behaviour to the hypothesis that adhd is a genetic condition other areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children the method of diagnosis and the possibility of overdiagnosis in  the national institute for health and care excellence while acknowledging the controversy states that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature in  keith conners one of the early advocates for recognition of the disorder spoke out against overdiagnosis in a new york times article in contrast a  peerreviewed medical literature review indicated that adhd is underdiagnosed in adultswith widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries states within countries races and ethnicities some suspect factors other than the presence of the symptoms of adhd are playing a role in diagnosis such as cultural norms some sociologists consider adhd to be an example of the medicalization of deviant behaviour that is the turning of the previously nonmedical issue of school performance into a medical one most healthcare providers accept adhd as a genuine disorder at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater number of people with mild symptomsthe nature and range of desirable endpoints of adhd treatment vary among diagnostic standards for adhd in most studies the efficacy of treatment is determined by reductions in adhd symptoms however some studies have included subjective ratings from teachers and parents as part of their assessment of adhd treatment efficacies by contrast the subjective ratings of children undergoing adhd treatment are seldom included in studies evaluating the efficacy of adhd treatmentsthere have been notable differences in the diagnosis patterns of birthdays in schoolage children those born relatively younger to the school starting age than others in a classroom environment are shown to be more likely diagnosed with adhd boys who were born in december in which the school age cutoff was december  were shown to be  more likely to be diagnosed and  to be treated than others born in january girls born in december had a diagnosis percentage of  and  treatment more than ones born the following month children who were born at the last  days of a calendar year were reported to have significantly higher levels of diagnosis and treatment for adhd than children born at the first  days of a calendar year the studies suggest that adhd diagnosis is prone to subjective analysispossible positive traits of adhd are a new avenue of research and therefore limiteda  review found that creativity may be associated with adhd symptoms particularly divergent thinking and quantity of creative achievements but not with the disorder of adhd itself – ie it has not been found to be increased in people diagnosed with the disorder only in people with subclinical symptoms or those that possess traits associated with the disorder divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative solutions which differ significantly from each other and consider the issue from multiple perspectives those with adhd symptoms could be advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse attention allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration flexible associative memory allowing them to remember and use more distantlyrelated ideas which is associated with creativity and impulsivity which causes people with adhd symptoms to consider ideas which others may not have however people with adhd may struggle with convergent thinking which is a cognitive process through which a set of obviously relevant knowledge is utilised in a focused effort to arrive at a single perceived best solution to a problema  article suggested that historical documentation supported leonardo da vincis difficulties with procrastination and time management as characteristic of adhd and that he was constantly on the go but often jumping from task to taskreviews of adhd biomarkers have noted that platelet monoamine oxidase expression urinary norepinephrine urinary mhpg and urinary phenethylamine levels consistently differ between adhd individuals and nonadhd controls these measurements could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for adhd but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility urinary and blood plasma phenethylamine concentrations are lower in adhd individuals relative to controls and the two most commonly prescribed drugs for adhd amphetamine and methylphenidate increase phenethylamine biosynthesis in treatmentresponsive individuals with adhd lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are also associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in adhd individuals'}\n"
