IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

      "p Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]\n",

      "p Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]\n",

The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking.

The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role.

In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms.

Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia.

These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings.

Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking.

Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n"

Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder.

IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia.

Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking.

Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings.

Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms. Aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures in individuals under 40 years of age are a major diagnostic criteria of the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS).[21]Incidence rates are two to three times higher in males, while there are more large and giant aneurysms and fewer multiple aneurysms.[13]:\\u200a235\\u200a Intracranial hemorrhages are 1.6 times more likely to be due to aneurysms than cerebral arteriovenous malformations in whites, but four times less in certain Asian populations.[13]:\\u200a235', 'Prevention': ''}}\n"

Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO).

These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms.

Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes.

In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure.

      "p There are several types of dermatitis including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis.[2] Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings.

Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Celiac disease': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Celiac disease': {'Symptoms': 'The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, or greasy stools (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder.

Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms. Aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures in individuals under 40 years of age are a major diagnostic criteria of the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS).[21]Incidence rates are two to three times higher in males, while there are more large and giant aneurysms and fewer multiple aneurysms.[13]:\\u200a235\\u200a Intracranial hemorrhages are 1.6 times more likely to be due to aneurysms than cerebral arteriovenous malformations in whites, but four times less in certain Asian populations.[13]:\\u200a235', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Osteomyelitits': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Atopic dermatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms refer to the sensations that people with AD feel, whereas signs refers to a description of the visible changes that result from AD.', 'Diagnosis': 'AD is typically diagnosed clinically, meaning it is based on signs and symptoms alone, without special testing.[46] Several different criteria developed for research have also been validated to aid in diagnosis.[47] Of these, the UK Diagnostic Criteria, based on the work of Hanifin and Rajka, has been the most widely validated.[47][48]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Eczema': {'Symptoms': 'There are several types of dermatitis including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis.[2] Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Celiac disease': {'Symptoms': 'The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, or greasy stools (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history.

Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Celiac disease': {'Symptoms': 'The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, or greasy stools (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS. Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings.[81][82]The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech).[178] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\".[23]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'UTIs': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS. Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings.[81][82]The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech).[178] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\".[23]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'UTIs': {'Symptoms': 'Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection.

People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.[10] Rarely, the urine may appear bloody[7] or contain visible pus in the urine.[21]', 'Diagnosis': 'In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.[4] In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.[49] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.[4] As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.[11]In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may be the cause.[10][50] These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection.[51] Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.[52] Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[53]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[38] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[7] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying[57] which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[citation needed]\"}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking.

These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder.

Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms. Aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures in individuals under 40 years of age are a major diagnostic criteria of the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS).[21]Incidence rates are two to three times higher in males, while there are more large and giant aneurysms and fewer multiple aneurysms.[13]:\\u200a235\\u200a Intracranial hemorrhages are 1.6 times more likely to be due to aneurysms than cerebral arteriovenous malformations in whites, but four times less in certain Asian populations.[13]:\\u200a235', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Osteomyelitits': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Atopic dermatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms refer to the sensations that people with AD feel, whereas signs refers to a description of the visible changes that result from AD.', 'Diagnosis': 'AD is typically diagnosed clinically, meaning it is based on signs and symptoms alone, without special testing.[46] Several different criteria developed for research have also been validated to aid in diagnosis.[47] Of these, the UK Diagnostic Criteria, based on the work of Hanifin and Rajka, has been the most widely validated.[47][48]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Eczema': {'Symptoms': 'There are several types of dermatitis including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis.[2] Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Celiac disease': {'Symptoms': 'The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, or greasy stools (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS. Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings.[81][82]The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech).[178] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\".[23]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'UTIs': {'Symptoms': 'Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection. The most common symptoms are burning with urination and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of vaginal discharge and significant pain.[4] These symptoms may vary from mild to severe[10] and in healthy women last an average of six days.[19] Some pain above the pubic bone or in the lower back may be present. People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.[10] Rarely, the urine may appear bloody[7] or contain visible pus in the urine.[21]', 'Diagnosis': 'In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.[4] In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.[49] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.[4] As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.[11]In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may be the cause.[10][50] These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection.[51] Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.[52] Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[53]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[38] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[7] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying[57] which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[citation needed]\"}, 'Ovarian cysts': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS. Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings.[81][82]The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech).[178] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\".[23]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'UTIs': {'Symptoms': 'Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection.

People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.[10] Rarely, the urine may appear bloody[7] or contain visible pus in the urine.[21]', 'Diagnosis': 'In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.[4] In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.[49] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.[4] As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.[11]In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may be the cause.[10][50] These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection.[51] Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.[52] Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[53]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[38] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[7] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying[57] which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[citation needed]\"}, 'Ovarian cysts': {'Symptoms': 'Some or all of the following symptoms may be present, though it is possible not to experience any symptoms:[4]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ovarian cysts are usually diagnosed by ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, and correlated with clinical presentation and endocrinologic tests as appropriate.[10]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n"

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. If ANA is negative the disease can be ruled out.[79]Some people, especially those with antiphospholipid syndrome, may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.[91][92][93]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Celiac disease': {'Symptoms': 'The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, or greasy stools (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS. Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings.[81][82]The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech).[178] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\".[23]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'UTIs': {'Symptoms': 'Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection. The most common symptoms are burning with urination and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of vaginal discharge and significant pain.[4] These symptoms may vary from mild to severe[10] and in healthy women last an average of six days.[19] Some pain above the pubic bone or in the lower back may be present. People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.[10] Rarely, the urine may appear bloody[7] or contain visible pus in the urine.[21]', 'Diagnosis': 'In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.[4] In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.[49] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.[4] As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.[11]In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may be the cause.[10][50] These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection.[51] Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.[52] Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[53]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[38] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[7] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying[57] which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[citation needed]\"}, 'Ovarian cysts': {'Symptoms': 'Some or all of the following symptoms may be present, though it is possible not to experience any symptoms:[4]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ovarian cysts are usually diagnosed by ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, and correlated with clinical presentation and endocrinologic tests as appropriate.[10]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Rabies': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}}\n",

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).', 'Diagnosis': 'Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present. Most patients will receive a blood test. Others might need an ultrasound, biopsy or a radioiodine scanning and uptake study.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Diabetic neuropathy': {'Symptoms': 'Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.[38]', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection.[19]:\\u200a602\\u200a Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms.

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.[5] In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.[78] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[79]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"Exclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.[34] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk,[34] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[34] There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[35] There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing eczema.[36] In fact, it may increase the risk of skin infection and of unwanted effects such as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation.[36]\"}, 'Gum disease': {'Symptoms': 'In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:'}, 'Breast cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[18] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[19][20] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[18] may also indicate breast cancer.', 'Diagnosis': 'Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.', 'RiskFactors': 'Risk factors can be divided into two categories:', 'Prevention': 'Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[133] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[133] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[133][134] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[135] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[40] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[136]'}, 'Ovarian cancer': {'Symptoms': 'Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment.

Microscopic analysis of samples is the only direct method that allows for the identification of rabies virus-specific antigen in a short time and at a reduced cost, irrespective of geographical origin and status of the host. It has to be regarded as the first step in diagnostic procedures for all laboratories. Autolysed samples can, however, reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the FAT.[58] The RT PCR assays proved to be a sensitive and specific tool for routine diagnostic purposes,[59] particularly in decomposed samples[60] or archival specimens.[61] The diagnosis can be reliably made from brain samples taken after death.

About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms.[19] The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles in the affected leg and relieved by rest.[30] This occurs because during exercise the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen of the muscles and as a result the muscles are deprived of oxygen leading to pain of the muscle that subsides with rest.[30]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires history of symptoms and a physical exam followed by confirmatory testing.[20] These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomagraphic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging.[31] In the setting of symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease a physician will then examine an individual for specific exam findings. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a health care provider to consider a specific diagnosis.[19] However, in order to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.[20]', 'RiskFactors': 'Factors contributing to increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis.[34][35] These include age, sex, and ethnicity.[36] PAD is two times as common in males as females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio.[37] The factors with the greatest risk association are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD ten-fold.[38]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hepatitis': {'Symptoms': 'Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]', 'Diagnosis': \"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[31] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][31] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[31] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[31] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[68]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[78][79]'}, 'Cirrhosis': {'Symptoms': 'Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[8] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[8] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[8]', 'Diagnosis': 'The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[23] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and patient history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[23] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[36]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[98]'}, 'Polycystic kidney disease': {'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.[1] Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.[23] A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure[1]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Brain aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.[10]', 'Diagnosis': 'Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography.[28] But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram.[28][29] The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.[30]', 'RiskFactors': 'Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms.[11][12][17] Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.[12]', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Schizophrenia': {'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[30] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][31] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[32][33]Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[32] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[34] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices) but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch.[35] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[34] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[36] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[37] Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication,[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7]Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy.[38][39] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[40][41] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[41] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[38][42] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[43] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[44]An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset and late-onset illness.[50][51] These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood.[52][53] They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms.[54][55] However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms.[52] Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.[56][57]\", 'Diagnosis': 'Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment.[155] An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[156] This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) have been introduced.[46] The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.[54]To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded.[167]:\\u200a858\\u200a Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.[7]Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties within patriarchy as wives and mothers.[255] In the mid-to-late 1960s, black men were categorized as \"hostile and aggressive\" and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.[255][256]', 'RiskFactors': 'Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors.[5][75][76] The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved.[76] A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia.[76][77] The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain.[78] Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.[78]', 'Prevention': 'Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[172] It is unclear as of 2011 whether treating patients in the prodrome phase of schizophrenia provides benefits.[needs update][173]:\\u200a43\\u200a There is a discrepancy between the growth in the implementation of early intervention programmes for psychosis and the underlying empirical evidence.[173]:\\u200a44'}, 'Gastroenteritis': {'Symptoms': 'Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]', 'Diagnosis': \"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]\", 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44] Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]'}, 'Asthma': {'Symptoms': 'Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[22] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[23] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[24] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[25] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[26]', 'Diagnosis': 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[21] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[22]Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[135] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[136] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term \"asthma\" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[137] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[135]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[141] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[142][143] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[141]'}, 'Pneumonia': {'Symptoms': 'People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing.[9] In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.[60] In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.[61] However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause.[12][60] The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.[62]The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.[63] A rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old.[63]In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases.[67] There is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.[68] C-reactive protein (CRP) may help support the diagnosis.[69] For those with CRP less than 20 mg/L without convincing evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not recommended.[40]Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary edema, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and pulmonary emboli.[9] Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with wheezing, pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram, cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli present with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath.[9] Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from acute heart failure. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving mechanical ventilation should point to heart failure and atelectasis rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a foreign bodies, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be suspected.[40]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[23] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[25]'}, 'Tuberculosis': {'Symptoms': 'Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73]', 'RiskFactors': 'A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47]', 'Prevention': 'Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84]'}, 'Glaucoma': {'Symptoms': 'As open-angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process, screening through regular eye exams is important.

Testing for glaucoma includes measurements of the intraocular pressure using tonometry,[46] anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy as well as examination of the optic nerve to discern visible damage, changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test is performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).[47][48][49] Visual field loss is the most specific sign of the condition, though it occurs later in the course of the disease.[50]A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[122] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Hyperopia or farsightedness': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Thyroid disease': {'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of the condition vary with type: hypo- vs. hyperthyroidism, which are further described below.', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of thyroid disease depends on symptoms and whether or not a thyroid nodule is present.

Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected.[citation needed]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Muscle weakness, pain, balance loss, and lower limb dysfunction are the most common clinical manifestations.[5] Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes. The most useful physical examination finding for large fiber neuropathy is an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely.[6] Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.[7] Small fiber neuropathy measured by QST and Sudomotor function tests, through electrochemical skin conductance, is more and more indicated to assess early signs of diabetic neuropathy[8][9][10] and autonomic neuropathy.[11]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications.[13][14] Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls.[15]'}, 'Sciatica': {'Symptoms': '', 'Diagnosis': '', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Aneurysm': {'Symptoms': 'Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray.[19] Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan.

Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.

In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[32] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[33]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][56] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]', 'RiskFactors': \"There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[35] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[35] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][35][36] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[36] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]\", 'Prevention': 'Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][83]'}, 'Lupus': {'Symptoms': 'SLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.[12] SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis,[13] because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably.

Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]', 'Diagnosis': 'Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Ankylosing spondylitis': {'Symptoms': 'The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age.[9] Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.[10] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.[9]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.[21][22] Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).[21]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Multiple sclerosis': {'Symptoms': 'A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.[1] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision,[24] pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination, and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis,[25] or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.[1] When multiple sclerosis is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases.[26]Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[134] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed.[1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.', 'Diagnosis': 'Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.[5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[1][66]Several diseases present similarly to MS.[81][82] Medical professionals use a patient\\'s specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential. Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS. Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings.[81][82]The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech).[178] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\".[23]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'UTIs': {'Symptoms': 'Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection. The most common symptoms are burning with urination and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of vaginal discharge and significant pain.[4] These symptoms may vary from mild to severe[10] and in healthy women last an average of six days.[19] Some pain above the pubic bone or in the lower back may be present. People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.[10] Rarely, the urine may appear bloody[7] or contain visible pus in the urine.[21]', 'Diagnosis': 'In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.[4] In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.[49] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.[4] As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.[11]In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may be the cause.[10][50] These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection.[51] Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.[52] Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[53]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': \"A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[38] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[7] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying[57] which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[citation needed]\"}, 'Ovarian cysts': {'Symptoms': 'Some or all of the following symptoms may be present, though it is possible not to experience any symptoms:[4]', 'Diagnosis': 'Ovarian cysts are usually diagnosed by ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, and correlated with clinical presentation and endocrinologic tests as appropriate.[10]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': ''}, 'Rabies': {'Symptoms': 'The period between infection and the first symptoms (incubation period) is typically one—three months in humans.[22] This period may be as short as four days or longer than six years, depending on the location and severity of the wound and the amount of virus introduced.[22] Initial symptoms of rabies are often nonspecific such as fever and headache.[22] As rabies progresses and causes inflammation of the brain and meninges, symptoms can include slight or partial paralysis, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, agitation, abnormal behavior, paranoia, terror, and hallucinations.[9][22] The person may also have fear of water.[1]', 'Diagnosis': 'Rabies can be difficult to diagnose because, in the early stages, it is easily confused with other diseases or even with a simple aggressive temperament.[56] The reference method for diagnosing rabies is the fluorescent antibody test (FAT), an immunohistochemistry procedure, which is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[57] The FAT relies on the ability of a detector molecule (usually fluorescein isothiocyanate) coupled with a rabies-specific antibody, forming a conjugate, to bind to and allow the visualisation of rabies antigen using fluorescent microscopy techniques. Microscopic analysis of samples is the only direct method that allows for the identification of rabies virus-specific antigen in a short time and at a reduced cost, irrespective of geographical origin and status of the host. It has to be regarded as the first step in diagnostic procedures for all laboratories. Autolysed samples can, however, reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the FAT.[58] The RT PCR assays proved to be a sensitive and specific tool for routine diagnostic purposes,[59] particularly in decomposed samples[60] or archival specimens.[61] The diagnosis can be reliably made from brain samples taken after death. The diagnosis can also be made from saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, but this is not as sensitive or reliable as brain samples.[58] Cerebral inclusion bodies called Negri bodies are 100% diagnostic for rabies infection but are found in only about 80% of cases.[29] If possible, the animal from which the bite was received should also be examined for rabies.[62]', 'RiskFactors': '', 'Prevention': 'Almost all human exposure to rabies was fatal until a vaccine was developed in 1885 by Louis Pasteur and Émile Roux. Their original vaccine was harvested from infected rabbits, from which the virus in the nerve tissue was weakened by allowing it to dry for five to ten days.[68] Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used in some countries, as they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines.[69]'}}\n"

       "{'Symptoms': 'The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort that occurs regularly with activity, after eating, or at other predictable times; this phenomenon is termed stable angina and is associated with narrowing of the arteries of the heart. Angina also includes chest tightness, heaviness, pressure, numbness, fullness, or squeezing.[27] Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction. In adults who go to the emergency department with an unclear cause of pain, about 30% have pain due to coronary artery disease.[28] Angina, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, and lightheadedness are signs of a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, and immediate emergency medical services are crucial.[27]With advanced disease, the narrowing of coronary arteries reduces the supply of oxygen-rich blood flowing to the heart, which becomes more pronounced during strenuous activities during which the heart beats faster.[29] For some, this causes severe symptoms, while others experience no symptoms at all.[4]',\n",
       " 'Symptoms in women[edit]': 'Symptoms in women can differ from those in men, and the most common symptom reported by women of all races is shortness of breath.[30] Other symptoms more commonly reported by women than men are extreme fatigue, sleep disturbances, indigestion, and anxiety.[31] However, some women do experience irregular heartbeat, dizziness, sweating, and nausea.[27] Burning, pain, or pressure in the chest or upper abdomen that can travel to the arm or jaw can also be experienced in women, but it is less commonly reported by women than men.[31] On average, women experience symptoms 10 years later than men.[32] Women are less likely to recognize symptoms and seek treatment.[27]Coronary artery disease is characterized by heart problems that result from atherosclerosis.[33] Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis which is the \"chronic inflammation of the arteries which causes them to harden and accumulate cholesterol plaques (atheromatous plaques) on the artery walls\".[34] CAD has a number of well determined risk factors that contribute to atherosclerosis. These risk factors for CAD include \"smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), abnormal (high) amounts of cholesterol and other fat in the blood (dyslipidemia), type 2 diabetes and being overweight or obese (having excess body fat)\" due to lack of exercise and a poor diet.[35] Some other risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, family history, psychological stress and excessive alcohol.[6][7][18] About half of cases are linked to genetics.[36] Smoking and obesity are associated with about 36% and 20% of cases, respectively.[37] Smoking just one cigarette per day about doubles the risk of CAD.[38] Lack of exercise has been linked to 7–12% of cases.[37][39] Exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange may increase risk.[40] Rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis are independent risk factors as well.[41][42][43][44][excessive citations]Job stress appears to play a minor role accounting for about 3% of cases.[37] In one study, women who were free of stress from work life saw an increase in the diameter of their blood vessels, leading to decreased progression of atherosclerosis.[45] In contrast, women who had high levels of work-related stress experienced a decrease in the diameter of their blood vessels and significantly increased disease progression.[45] Having a type A behavior pattern, a group of personality characteristics including time urgency, competitiveness, hostility, and impatience,[46] is linked to an increased risk of coronary disease.[47]The consumption of different types of fats including trans unsaturated, saturated and trans in a diet \"influences the level of cholesterol that is present in the bloodstream\".[48] Unsaturated fats originate from plant sources (such as oils). There are two types of unsaturated fats, cis and trans isomers. Cis unsaturated fats are bent in molecular structure and trans are linear in structure. Saturated fats originate from animal sources (such as animal fats) and are also molecularly linear in structure.[49] The linear configurations of unsaturated trans and saturated fats allow them to easily accumulate and stack at the arterial walls when consumed in high amounts (and other positive measures towards physical health are not met).High levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream lead to atherosclerosis. With increased levels of LDL in the bloodstream, \"LDL particles will form deposits and accumulate within the arterial walls, which will lead to the development of plaques, restricting blood flow\".[48] The resultant reduction in the heart\\'s blood supply due to atherosclerosis in coronary arteries \"causes shortness of breath, angina pectoris (chest pains that are usually relieved by rest), and potentially fatal heart attacks (myocardial infarctions)\".[35]The heritability of coronary artery disease has been estimated between 40% and 60%.[50] Genome-wide association studies have identified over 160 genetic susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease.[51]Transcripts associated with CAD (TRACs) - FoxP1, ICOSLG, IKZF4/Eos, SMYD3, TRIM28, and TCF3/E2A that are likely markers of regulatory T cells (Treg), consistent with known reductions in Tregs in CAD.[52]The RNA changes are mostly related to ciliary and endocytic transcripts, which in the circulating immune system would be related to the immune synapse. The immune synapse is the contact-dependent mode of communication between T cells and B cells, on one side, and a variety of antigen-presenting and immunomodulating cells on the other side.[53] One of the most differentially expressed genes, fibromodulin (FMOD, increased 2.8-fold in CAD). Several other regulated transcripts encode for proteins related to the structure and function of the immune synapse. Nebulette, the most down-regulated transcript (2.4-fold), is an important \\'cytolinker\\' that connects actin and desmin to facilitate cytoskeletal function and vesicular movement. The endocytic pathway is further modulated by changes in tubulin, which is a key microtubule protein, and fidgetin, which is a tubulin-severing enzyme that is a GWAS marker for CV risk. Protein recycling would be modulated by changes in the proteasomal regulator SIAH3, and the ubiquitin ligase MARCHF10. On the ciliary aspect of the immune synapse, several of the modulated transcripts are related to ciliary length and function. Steriocilin (STRC) has been studied principally in outer sensory hair cells, and mutations lead to deafness. Steriocilin is a partner to mesothelin (MSN), a related super-helical protein, whose transcript is also modulated in CAD. Likewise, DCDC2, a double-cortin protein, is a known modulator of ciliary length. In the signaling pathways of the immune synapse, there were numerous transcripts that related directly to T cell function and the control of differentiation. Butyrophilin (BTN1A1) is a known co-regulator for T cell activation. Fibromodulin is a well-known modulator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, which is a primary determinant of Tre differentiation. Further impact on the TGF-beta pathway is reflected in concurrent changes in the BMP receptor 1B RNA (BMPR1B), because the bone morphogenic proteins are members of the TGF-beta superfamily, and likewise impact Treg differentiation. As noted, several of the transcripts (TMEM98, NRCAM, SFRP5, SHISA2) are known elements of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is major determinant of Treg differentiation.Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes ischemia (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the heart\\'s muscle cells. The heart\\'s muscle cells may die from lack of oxygen and this is called a myocardial infarction (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade narrowing of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as ventricular fibrillation, which often leads to death.[60]Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a coronary artery (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops atherosclerosis. With atherosclerosis, the artery\\'s lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory cells – to form a plaque. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary arteriosclerosis. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of calciphylaxis as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis.[citation needed] Although these people have kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large \"pimples\" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing partial obstruction to blood flow. People with coronary artery disease might have just one or two plaques, or might have dozens distributed throughout their coronary arteries. A more severe form is chronic total occlusion (CTO) when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.[61]Cardiac syndrome X is chest pain (angina pectoris) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger coronary arteries of their hearts when an angiogram (coronary angiogram) is being performed.[62] The exact cause of cardiac syndrome X is unknown. Explanations include microvascular dysfunction or epicardial atherosclerosis.[63][64] For reasons that are not well understood, women are more likely than men to have it; however, hormones and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.[65]For symptomatic people, stress echocardiography can be used to make a diagnosis for obstructive coronary artery disease.[66] The use of echocardiography, stress cardiac imaging, and/or advanced non-invasive imaging is not recommended on individuals who are exhibiting no symptoms and are otherwise at low risk for developing coronary disease.[66][67]The diagnosis of \"Cardiac Syndrome X\" – the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, usually, the same tests are used as in any person with the suspected of having coronary artery disease:[68]The diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), both for \"stable\" angina and acute coronary syndrome. An X-ray of the chest and blood tests may be performed.[69]Stable angina is the most common form of ischemic heart disease, and is associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality. It is caused by epicardial coronary stenosis which results in reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the myocardium.[70] Stable angina is characterized as short-term chest pain during physical exertion caused by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and metabolic oxygen demand. Various forms of cardiac stress tests may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), echocardiography (using ultrasound of the heart) or scintigraphy (using uptake of radionuclide by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, coronary angiography may be used to identify stenosis of the coronary arteries and suitability for angioplasty or bypass surgery.[71]In minor to moderate cases, nitroglycerine may be used to alleviate acute symptoms of stable angina or may be used immediately prior to exertion to prevent the onset of angina. Sublingual nitroglycerine is most commonly used to provide rapid relief for acute angina attacks and as a complement to anti-anginal treatments in patients with refractory and recurrent angina.[72] When nitroglycerine enters the bloodstream, it forms free radical nitric oxide, or NO, which activates guanylate cyclase and in turn stimulates the release of cyclic GMP. This molecular signaling stimulates smooth muscle relaxation, ultimately resulting in vasodilation and consequently improved blood flow to regions of the heart affected by atherosclerotic plaque.[73]Stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) is also often called stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD).[74] A 2015 monograph explains that \"Regardless of the nomenclature, stable angina is the chief manifestation of SIHD or SCAD.\"[74] There are U.S. and European clinical practice guidelines for SIHD/SCAD.[75][76]Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome generally takes place in the emergency department, where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify \"evolving changes\" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the \"ST segment\", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent insertion) or with thrombolysis (\"clot buster\" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by cardiac markers (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage (infarction), the chest pain is attributed to a \"non-ST elevation MI\" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term \"unstable angina\" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a coronary care unit for possible complications (such as cardiac arrhythmias – irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.[citation needed]There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is Framingham Score, used in the Framingham Heart Study. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking, and systolic blood pressure. When it comes to predicting risk in younger adults (18–39 years old), Framingham Risk Score remains below 10-12% for all deciles of baseline-predicted risk.[77]Polygenic score is another way of risk assessment. In one study the relative risk of incident coronary events was 91% higher among participants at high genetic risk than among those at low genetic risk.[78]Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.[79][80] Prevention involves adequate physical exercise, decreasing obesity, treating high blood pressure, eating a healthy diet, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stopping smoking. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective.[81] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by about 25%.[82] Life\\'s Essential 8 are the key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health, as defined by the American Heart Association. AHA added sleep as a factor influencing heart health in 2022.[83]Most guidelines recommend combining these preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that counseling and education to bring about behavioral change might help in high-risk groups. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardiovascular events.[84]In diabetes mellitus, there is little evidence that very tight blood sugar control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems such as kidney failure and blindness.[85] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends \"low to moderate alcohol intake\" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease while high intake increases the risk.[86]A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.[87] Vegetarians have a lower risk of heart disease,[88][89] possibly due to their greater consumption of fruits and vegetables.[90] Evidence also suggests that the Mediterranean diet[91] and a high fiber diet lower the risk.[92][93]The consumption of trans fat (commonly found in hydrogenated products such as margarine) has been shown to cause a precursor to atherosclerosis[94] and increase the risk of coronary artery disease.[95]Evidence does not support a beneficial role for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death).[96][97] There is tentative evidence that intake of menaquinone (Vitamin K2), but not phylloquinone (Vitamin K1), may reduce the risk of CAD mortality.[98]Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Effective lifestyle changes include:Aerobic exercise, like walking, jogging, or swimming, can reduce the risk of mortality from coronary artery disease.[101] Aerobic exercise can help decrease blood pressure and the amount of blood cholesterol (LDL) over time. It also increases HDL cholesterol.[102][better source needed][103]Although exercise is beneficial, it is unclear whether doctors should spend time counseling patients to exercise. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found \"insufficient evidence\" to recommend that doctors counsel patients on exercise but \"it did not review the evidence for the effectiveness of physical activity to reduce chronic disease, morbidity, and mortality\", only the effectiveness of counseling itself.[104] The American Heart Association, based on a non-systematic review, recommends that doctors counsel patients on exercise.[105]Psychological symptoms are common in people with CHD, and while many psychological treatments may be offered following cardiac events, there is no evidence that they change mortality, the risk of revascularization procedures, or the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction.[100]Antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart diseaseAntibiotics may help patients with coronary disease to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.[106] However, the latest evidence suggests that antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are harmful with increased mortality and occurrence of stroke.[106] So, the use of antibiotics is not currently supported for preventing secondary coronary heart disease.A thorough systematic review found that indeed there is a link between a CHD condition and brain dysfunction in females/women.[107] Consequently, since research is showing that cardiovascular diseases, like CHD, can play a role as a precursor for dementia, like Alzheimer\\'s disease, individuals with CHD should have a neuropsychological assessment.[108]There are a number of treatment options for coronary artery disease:[109]It is recommended that blood pressure typically be reduced to less than 140/90 mmHg.[114] The diastolic blood pressure however should not be lower than 60 mmHg. Beta blockers are recommended first line for this use.[114]In those with no previous history of heart disease, aspirin decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction but does not change the overall risk of death.[115] It is thus recommended only in adults who are at increased risk for coronary artery disease[116] where increased risk is defined as \"men older than 90 years of age, postmenopausal women, and younger persons with risk factors for coronary artery disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes, or smoking) who are at increased risk for heart disease and may wish to consider aspirin therapy\". More specifically, high-risk persons are \"those with a 5-year risk ≥ 3%\".[citation needed]Clopidogrel plus aspirin (dual anti-platelet therapy) reduces cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone in those with a STEMI. In others at high risk but not having an acute event, the evidence is weak.[117] Specifically, its use does not change the risk of death in this group.[118] In those who have had a stent, more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect the risk of death.[119]Revascularization for acute coronary syndrome has a mortality benefit.[120] Percutaneous revascularization for stable ischaemic heart disease does not appear to have benefits over medical therapy alone.[121] In those with disease in more than one artery, coronary artery bypass grafts appear better than percutaneous coronary interventions.[122] Newer \"anaortic\" or no-touch off-pump coronary artery revascularization techniques have shown reduced postoperative stroke rates comparable to percutaneous coronary intervention.[123] Hybrid coronary revascularization has also been shown to be a safe and feasible procedure that may offer some advantages over conventional CABG though it is more expensive.[124]As of 2010, CAD was the leading cause of death globally resulting in over 7 million deaths.[126] This increased from 5.2 million deaths from CAD worldwide in 1990.[126] It may affect individuals at any age but becomes dramatically more common at progressively older ages, with approximately a tripling with each decade of life.[127] Males are affected more often than females.[127]It is estimated that 60% of the world\\'s cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world\\'s population. This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Organizations such as the Indian Heart Association are working with the World Heart Federation to raise awareness about this issue.[128]Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women and accounts for approximately 600,000 deaths in the United States every year.[129] According to present trends in the United States, half of healthy 40-year-old men will develop CAD in the future, and one in three healthy 40-year-old women.[130] It is the most common reason for death of men and women over 20 years of age in the United States.[131]Other terms sometimes used for this condition are \"hardening of the arteries\" and \"narrowing of the arteries\".[132] In Latin it is known as morbus ischaemicus cordis (MIC).The Infarct Combat Project (ICP) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1998 which tries to decrease ischemic heart diseases through education and research.[133]In 2016 research into the archives of the[failed verification]Sugar Association, the trade association for the sugar industry in the US, had sponsored an influential literature review published in 1965 in the New England Journal of Medicine that downplayed early findings about the role of a diet heavy in sugar in the development of CAD and emphasized the role of fat; that review influenced decades of research funding and guidance on healthy eating.[134][135][136][137]Research efforts are focused on new angiogenic treatment modalities and various (adult) stem-cell therapies. A region on chromosome 17 was confined to families with multiple cases of myocardial infarction.[138] Other genome-wide studies have identified a firm risk variant on chromosome 9 (9p21.3).[139] However, these and other loci are found in intergenic segments and need further research in understanding how the phenotype is affected.[140]A more controversial link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis.[141] While this intracellular organism has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive as to whether it can be considered a causative factor.[142] Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular diseases.[143]Since the 1990s the search for new treatment options for coronary artery disease patients, particularly for so called \"no-option\" coronary patients, focused on usage of angiogenesis[144] and (adult) stem cell therapies. Numerous clinical trials were performed, either applying protein (angiogenic growth factor) therapies, such as FGF-1 or VEGF, or cell therapies using different kinds of adult stem cell populations. Research is still going on – with first promising results particularly for FGF-1[145][146] and utilization of endothelial progenitor cells.Myeloperoxidase has been proposed as a biomarker.[147]Plant-based nutrition has been suggested as a way to reverse coronary artery disease,[148] but strong evidence is still lacking for claims of potential benefits.[149]Several immunosuppressive drugs targeting the chronic inflammation in coronary artery disease have been tested.[150]',\n",
